  "Traveling Toddler Car Seat Travel Accessory ATTN: Britax owners. If our product is too short, please check to be sure your LATCH straps are in the forward facing position. Whether flying on an airplane or traveling by train or bus, it is safest and most comfortable for your child to be in a car seat. But traveling with a young child, their seat, and your carry-on can be tricky. Not anymore. The Traveling Toddler strap allows you to attach your LATCH and top tether equipped toddler's car seat to a rolling carry-on suitcase. Simply attach the LATCH and top tether straps from the car seat to the Traveling Toddler and adjust the straps so that the car seat is held securely on the suitcase. Once adjusted, the car seat can be detached and reattached to the suitcase in seconds. Lift the handle of your carry-on bag and you have a fun new stroller. Now there's an easy and inexpensive way to take your toddler's car seat and other gear on your trip. You do not have to buy a special seat or suitcase. As long as your suitcase handle locks in place, you can push it like a stroller. Your hands are free for check in and its simple to unhook for security. Keep your child safe and comfortable in their own seat. The Traveling Toddler has been tested with most major car seat brands including Graco, Eddie Bauer, Cosco, Evenflo, and Britax, and a variety of carry-on suitcases and has worked with every combination. It is important that the telescoping handle of your suitcase locks in place. If not, it might not stay extended when you try to push your child in front of you, though you would still be able to pull them. If flying, make sure that your car seat is FAA approved before traveling. The Traveling Toddler strap is made from heavyweight polypropylene webbing that will withstand 900 lbs of force. When not in use it easily slips in the pocket of your carry-on. As with any other wheeled child carrier, do not use the Traveling Toddler on stairs or escalators. Car seat and suitcase sold separately. Patent pending.",

  "Medela Pump in Style Advanced Double Breast Pump The most important difference between the Medela Pump in Style Advanced model and the Original is that the Advanced pump includes a pretty remarkable feature that actually mimics a baby&#x92;s nursing rhythm by pumping in two distinct modes: let-down and expression. In the first few moments of nursing, babies initiate faster milk flow by suckling rapidly. After the flow is established, baby switches to slower, deeper suckling for maximum milk flow in less time. The \"Natural Expression\" system simulates this two-stage pattern for a highly efficient, effective pumping experience. In other ways the pump is similar to the also first-rate Original: a stylish and professional looking black shoulder bag houses the pump with adjustable speed and vacuum control, along with battery pack, AC adapter, four bottles with lids, bottle stands, \"PersonalFit\" breastshields, removable cooler carrier with ice packs, bottle holder, extra storage pockets, and a built-in picture frame for a photo of your pride and joy. The advanced model also includes CSF breastmilk bags, a padded carrier case for the battery pack, and a removable motor bag.--Emilie Coulter",

  "Britax Marathon Convertible Car Seat, Granite Britax International has been manufacturing innovative, industry-leading child products for over three decades. Their dedication to safety, comfort, and convenience is certainly apparent in this convertible car seat. Its ample attributes&#x97;both for parents and baby&#x97;and amazing attention to safety standards, make the Marathon a true front runner.Safety first is a good rule of thumb, and one that Britax certainly heeds. The Marathon offers features you might find on many other car seats, such as convertibility, a five-point harness, and the LATCH system. But Britax enhanced and then went above and beyond the norm when creating the Marathon.The Marathon can be easily rear-facing installed with today&#x92;s LATCH system.Their five-point harness system is made with strong polyester webbing, fits snugly over baby&#x92;s shoulders, collarbone and hips to provide a secure fit, and the straps are designed to remain tangle free. There are also four adjustable height positions so the seat grows with baby. A patented \"floating\" HUGS&#x99; (Harness Ultra Guard) system better distributes the webbing loads, reducing head movement and minimizing harness irritation on baby&#x92;s neck in case of an impact. HUGS also reduces the chance of improperly positioning the chest clip.Located near a vehicle's seatbelts, factory installed anchor points provide a secure and easy LATCH connection. In conjunction with this push-button release system, the Marathon also offers Britax&#x92;s Versa-Tether&#xAE;, an anchor aid that provides additional security in the forward facing position for children weighing more than 50 lbs. The Versa-Tether&#xAE; fastens the top of the car seat to factory installed automobile anchor points, minimizing the possibility of a head injury.The Marathon can also be safely used in cars without the LATCH system.Need more? The Marathon provides built-in lock-off clips that keep the seat tightly in place when using only traditional seatbelts at installation. A simple handle pull allows the car seat base to be easily reclined when rear-facing. A smooth ride is guaranteed for baby through the comfy padding and soft fabric cover, which is stain resistant, removable, and washable. The Marathon is Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 213 compliant, making it approved for airplane use as well.It should be noted that the Marathon is larger (28\"H x 19.5\"W x 25\"D) than most car seats, and can be a tricky fit, especially in the rear facing position in a smaller car. Allow for 31\" of backseat space to properly accommodate this model. With its bigger size this car seat is also heavier than many. Completely empty the Marathon weighs nearly 18 pounds. But these same features are what allow the car seat to have a higher weight capacity and therefore last well into childhood.A simple handle pull allows the car seat base to be reclined when rear-facing.Since car seats are mandated by law, it&#x92;s nice to know that Britax is at least making the choice simple for you. The Marathon is easy to install, super comfortable for baby, available in a wide range of colors and patterns, and, most importantly, safe!Comparing Britax Car SeatsIf you&#x92;re debating between the Britax Marathon and theBritax Roundabout, think of the latter as the little sibling. They are identical in comfort and convenience features, but the Marathon has a higher weight maximum, and is therefore larger than the Roundabout.TheBritax Decathlonis also similar to the Marathon, but offers two features you might need. First, the Decathlon offers additional padding for newborns with an infant positioning system, giving more peace of mind to first time parents. Second, the Decathlon offers an adjustable three-position crotch strap, which makes the seat more comfortable for toddlers consistently at the top of their height percentage.",

(Snappi terry cloth diapers, cotton pre-folds, and others) Note they do not work well with flannel or other tightly woven diapers.\n\nHow to use your Snappi:\n\nTo improve elasticity, stretch your Snappi fastener a few times before use.\n\nStep 1: Hook left\n\nStep 2: Stretch across and hook right\n\nStep 3: Stretch down and hook center\n\nThe Snappi should go from a \"T\" shape to a \"Y\" shape when stretched properly.\n\nWarning: Always use a cover over a Snappi fastener. Keep out of children's reach when not in use. Do not use a Snappi fastener on toddlers that have the ability to undo or take off their cover/diaper/clothes. Do not use your Snappi for longer than 6 months. Not UV resistant - exposure to the sun can reduce the effectiveness of the Snappi.\n\nCAUTION: Any tear in the Snappi can lead to separation of a piece, presenting a possible choking hazard. Inspect the Snappi before each use and discontinue using immediately if there is any sign of cracking, tearing, breakage or wear of the teeth or any other parts.

For 11 years, the firm fabricated machine and car parts for local manufacturers. In 1953, Gray left the firm, leaving Cone as sole owner. Cone decided to manufacture his own line of products, but had trouble coming up with ideas. Enter David Saint, an engineer, tinkerer, and stained glass artisan who worked for Graco. Saint, himself a father of nine, was intrigued when an associate told him how his wife would soothe their tired and cranky baby while swinging in a backyard glider swing. Acting on this inspiration, he went to the drawing board and 18 months of hard work later, the world's first wind-up infant swing, the Graco Swyngomatic, was born. Graco sold millions of Swyngomatics in the coming years, becoming one of the world's leading manufacturers of juvenile products in the process. Today, Graco is a Newell Rubbermaid company, with 1500 associates worldwide. While a half-century has brought many changes to Graco, their dedication and commitment to designing and manufacturing top-quality products remains, and continues on.",

Whether flying on an airplane or traveling by train or bus, it is safest and most comfortable for your child to be in a car seat. But traveling with a young child, their seat, and your carry-on can be tricky. Not anymore. The Traveling Toddler strap allows you to attach your LATCH and top tether equipped toddler's car seat to a rolling carry-on suitcase. Simply attach the LATCH and top tether straps from the car seat to the Traveling Toddler and adjust the straps so that the car seat is held securely on the suitcase.

Now there's an easy and inexpensive way to take your toddler's car seat and other gear on your trip. You do not have to buy a special seat or suitcase.

SnoozeShade was designed by a British mom who wanted her daughter to sleep well wherever she was and, when needed, be protected from the sun, SnoozeShade Original has a UPF50+ rating throughout (the maximum possible). SnoozeShade Original is made from a specially manufactured breathable and porous fabric. The woven fabric, which provides UPF50+ protection, allows air to circulate and has the added benefit of providing protection from insects and other flying bugs. Parents and careers can easily and quietly check on baby while she or he sleeps using the 'sneak-a-peek' front zip. Whilst SnoozeShade Original's primary purpose is to help babies sleep, it can also be used in two other ways to provide additional shade for your baby. When naptime is over, it can be used as a sun canopy extension on parent-facing strollers. It can also be used to provide extra shade over the stroller's hood on forward-facing strollers. Please see product images for examples. SnoozeShade Original is a PTPA Award winner, has the Great Dad Seal of Approval and was recently selected as one of Stroller Traffic's 'summer essentials' .

  "Playtex Diaper Genie Twist- Away Pail System Everyone agrees: dirty diapers stink. If parents could, they&#x92;d probably call in a genie to magic away all evidence of those poopy dipes. But for those who have not found an enchanted lamp lately, the new and improved Diaper Genie is a pretty good alternative. The basic idea is that you drop the used diaper into the bin, give the lid a few twists, and voila! The offensive item has been sealed away into a scented plastic liner. When the bin is full, open the base of the Genie and dump the sausaged, wrapped diapers into the garbage. No odor, no germs, no fuss!  The newly designed version features more convenient one-handed operation and a built-in cutting system (with safety latch to keep little fingers out) for easy and quick disposal. Inserting the refills has also been made easier--just remove the old refill, plop in the new one, and tie a knot. Includes one Stage 1 refill (for breast- or formula-fed babies only).

  "Britax Marathon in Ashley Floral This LATCH-equipped car seat converts from a rear-facing unit for infants (up to about 30 lbs.), to a forward-facing seat for kids at least a year old (up to 65 lbs.). To that end, the seat necessarily comes with belts, padded harnesses, and tethers--along the groin, waist, and shoulders--to prevent wobbling and leaning, and to allow the seat to be secured in cars that do not accommodate a LATCH system. It is therefore versatile enough for almost any car. Foam padding protects the head and sides, while two reclining positions make the ride even more enjoyable. The one caveat: the seat&#x92;s floral design may match your grandmother&#x92;s upholstered sofa from 20 years ago. But, unlike your grandmother&#x92;s sofa, this seat is not only machine-washable and stain-proofed, it&#x92;s removable and replaceable. Other seat cover designs are sold separately.--Diane Beall",

BALTIC AMBER TEETHING JEWELRY? The Art of Cure Brand AND Trademark is dedicated to providing the highest quality for Teething Babies. Baltic amber Jewelry is made for wearing (not chewing) when a baby is teething to reduce inflammation in the body. The warmth from the skin releases the active ingredient in the Baltic amber, succinic acid. Recent scientific research has proved that succinic acid has a very positive influence on the human body. It improves immunity and the balance of acids when absorbed into the bloodstream; it stimulates the thyroid glands to help reduce drooling when used for teething and soothes red inflamed cheeks. Amber's anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties are recognized by allopathic medicine as a natural analgesic, which will help to relieve teething pain and calm a baby without resorting to drugs. The skin's warmth releases healing oils from the amber, a resin, which is absorbed into the bloodstream. Parent supervision is recommended at all times. They are 12-12.5 in. Packaging is custom from The Art of Cure and comes with a Keepsake pouch. The Art of Cure Baltic Amber is guaranteed to be of the highest quality and made to the best standards.

  "Britax Marathon in Ashley Floral This LATCH-equipped car seat converts from a rear-facing unit for infants (up to about 30 lbs.), to a forward-facing seat for kids at least a year old (up to 65 lbs.). To that end, the seat necessarily comes with belts, padded harnesses, and tethers--along the groin, waist, and shoulders--to prevent wobbling and leaning, and to allow the seat to be secured in cars that do not accommodate a LATCH system. It is therefore versatile enough for almost any car. Foam padding protects the head and sides, while two reclining positions make the ride even more enjoyable. The one caveat: the seat&#x92;s floral design may match your grandmother&#x92;s upholstered sofa from 20 years ago. But, unlike your grandmother&#x92;s sofa, this seat is not only machine-washable and stain-proofed, it&#x92;s removable and replaceable. Other seat cover designs are sold separately.--Diane Beall",

BALTIC AMBER TEETHING JEWELRY? The Art of Cure Brand AND Trademark is dedicated to providing the highest quality for Teething Babies. Baltic amber Jewelry is made for wearing (not chewing) when a baby is teething to reduce inflammation in the body. The warmth from the skin releases the active ingredient in the Baltic amber, succinic acid. Recent scientific research has proved that succinic acid has a very positive influence on the human body. It improves immunity and the balance of acids when absorbed into the bloodstream; it stimulates the thyroid glands to help reduce drooling when used for teething and soothes red inflamed cheeks. Amber's anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties are recognized by allopathic medicine as a natural analgesic, which will help to relieve teething pain and calm a baby without resorting to drugs. The skin's warmth releases healing oils from the amber, a resin, which is absorbed into the bloodstream. Parent supervision is recommended at all times. They are 12-12.5 in. Packaging is custom from The Art of Cure and comes with a Keepsake pouch. The Art of Cure Baltic Amber is guaranteed to be of the highest quality and made to the best standards.

  "Philips Avent Electric Steam Sterilizer For parents of one or more bottle-fed babies, the Express Steam  Sterilizer is a real time-saver. Three ounces (90 milliliters) of water  and a standard household electrical outlet (three-prong) are all you  need to operate this self-contained, all-plastic unit. Measuring 12  inches high, you can fit up to six 9-ounce Avent bottles and a complete  Isis manual breast pump into the sterilizer at the same time. Fitting  the breast pump and all of the bottles, nipples, and sealing caps into  the sterilizer takes a little practice and you will probably have to  follow the illustrated instructions to load everything in correctly the  first time. But once you get the swing of it, it is relatively easy to  stack all the components properly and fit them into the sterilizer.  After it has been loaded it takes just eight minutes to run the  sterilizing cycle--with an additional cool-down time of three minutes.  All of the unit's internal stacking baskets can be run through the  dishwasher for periodic cleaning. Includes two 9-ounce Avent bottles.--Chris Burns",

  "Steribottle Ready to Use Disposable Baby Bottles,  10-Count Imagine if you don't have to wash or sterilize baby bottles or nipples anymore. Imagine the convenience of a disposable diaper but for baby bottles. Trusted by UK parents since 2000, Steri-bottle is the safe and simple way to feed your baby anytime, at home, or on the move. Steri-bottle is 100% BPA-free and phthalate-free, and is 100% recyclable. Steri-bottle is designed with care in the U.K. and made with pride in the USA. Each package contains 5 or 10 complete bottles and nipples. Steri-bottle is pre-sterilized and ready to use out of the box because the bottles and nipples are manufactured at high heat in a clean-room facility in Buffalo Grove, Illinois. No human hands touch the sterile bottles and nipples - the manufacturing and packaging process is automated. Use Steri-bottle when traveling. You used to pack an extra bag with clean bottles, nipples, brushes, and maybe even a sterilizing kit. You used to stay up late washing bottles when everyone else was asleep. Now, just open the Steri-bottle package, remove one pre-sterilized bottle and nipple. They're ready to use. Fill the bottle, warm it up, close the lid, and feed your child. When you're done, you can recycle the entire Steri-bottle. Use Steri-bottle at home. It's 3 a.m. &#x2013; it's time for a routine feed. Suddenly, you realize that there are no sterilized bottles in the cupboard. And you have to be at work in the morning and desperately want a few more minutes of sleep. There's no need to spend up to 10 minutes or more washing used bottles while half-asleep. Now you can just reach for a Steri-bottle. Open the box, take out a pre-sterilized bottle and nipple. Fill, close, and feed. This has taken you 10-15 seconds. Steri-bottle has been feeding babies and saving U.K. Moms and dads thousands and thousands of hours of bottle washing and sterilizing. When you can enjoy a few more moments, or go back to sleep faster, you will see why we say that Steri-bottle saves you time and more.",

  "green sprouts Natural Wood Ring Rattle For over two decades i play., Inc. has been researching children's health issues to make safer feeding accessories that come in contact with babies' mouths and foods. Due to recent safety issues in children's toys we saw a need for toys free from potentially harmful toxins. So in 2008 we launched a new line of PVC, phthalate, BPA and nitrosamine free toys made from synthetic materials. Inside Baby: Pregnancy and early childhood are critical times in babies' lives because they are growing and developing so rapidly. During this time they are vulnerable to elements in their environment, and parents should protect them as much as possible from exposure to potentially harmful substances. The first priority for growing babies is to make sure everything babies put inside their mouth is healthy, safe and promotes the development of strong immune system.  &#x2022; PVC free and Phthalate free: PolyVinyl Chloride (PVC) is a hard plastic that requires harsh chemical softeners, such as phthalates, to make it appropriate for use in soft plastic baby toys such as squirty toys. In 2003 we discovered that phthalates were shown to disrupt reproductive functions and cause other developmental problems, so we launched a line of toys free from PVC and phthalates.  &#x2022; BPA free: Bisphenol-A (BPA) is used in hard, clear plastics sometimes used in baby toys to prevent breakage. In 2006 we learned that BPA also disrupts reproductive functions and causes other developmental problems, so we added a line of BPA free toys to our line. &#x2022; Nitrosamine free: Nitrosamines are found in latex products such as some infant teethers.

  "Little Dundi My Early Steps Baby Walker, Tan My Early Steps is a soft-structured baby walker for use with infants who have demonstrated an ability to stand while supporting themselves against furniture or holding onto an adult's hand. This is indicative of completed changes in bodily proportion and sufficient leg muscle strength needed to enable the ability to balance in upright posture. My Early Steps is recommended for use with infants with a minimum chest circumference of 19 inches, weighing less than 30 pounds, and at least 8 months old. The unique shell design promotes a natural posture for baby &#x2013; the arms are used for balancing, which is key to maintaining balance while transitioning from one foot to the other, and the risk of shoulder dislocation caused by assisting adults pulling on baby&#x2019;s arms is minimized. Baby receives visual feedback related to each step as the view of baby's feet is unobstructed. The processing of such visual feedback by the brain is essential for independent walking. The adult also benefits from maintaining a natural, upright posture while using the walker. The lower part of the walker absorbs part of baby's weight and prevents the top part from gathering up under baby's arms during use, causing them to extend upwards. The wide leg openings allow for free leg movement and baby can gradually build up the upper muscle strength required for independent walking. The most unique feature of My Early Steps is the three-point fastening on the back. Situated close to the center of gravity of the baby it includes the lower point of attachment of the support straps. This is important because babies' center of gravity lies much higher than that of adults, making them top heavy. Positioning the point of attachment of the support straps close to the center of gravity affords better control for the adult and increased support for the top heavy infant. The support straps are easily removable and adjustable in length to accommodate adults of various heights. Babies can frequently tire of walking practice and want to switch to crawling. It is possible to let baby crawl without undue risk of entanglement - no need to remove the entire baby walker from baby, only the support straps. The three-point fastening allows for adjustments for baby's height and chest circumference (or thicker outerwear) and makes it possible to create a snug fi",

  "Sunshine Kids Radian XTSL Convertible Car Seat, Bentley The Radian XTSL Convertible Car Seat, Bentley (Model #19562) features the two highest weight limits in the market--an impressive 80 pounds in the forward-facing position and 45 pounds when rear-facing. Framed with steel alloy for safety, the seat offers side-impact protection with aluminum-reinforced sides, energy-absorbing EPS foam, and reinforced head support with adjustable head wings. Plus, it installs easily, thanks to a SuperLATCH system with a market-leading capacity of 80 pounds. The XTSL also boasts a handy padded shoulder strap, plush fabric, memory foam for superior comfort, and 3-in-1 infant/toddler full body support cushions.Radian XTSL ConvertibleCar SeatAt a Glance:Rating:Rear-facing position from 5 - 45 pounds; forward-facing up to 80 poundsIt is recommended to keep children rear facing as long as possibleIt is recommended to keep children in a 5 pt harness as long as possibleThe seat offers side-impact protection with aluminum-reinforced sides and energy-absorbing EPS foam.View larger.The XTSL features the highest weight limits in the market.The seat folds flat, so you can store it away or take it along for travel.(Shown here in Eclipse style.)View larger.Steel Frame and Side Impact ProtectionThe Radian XTSL Convertible Car Seat is constructed with a steel alloy frame for ultimate safety and strength, providing security for your child and peace of mind for you. The seat's side impact protection features include aluminum-reinforced sides and energy-absorbing EPS foam, which work together to protect the child's head and body and provide a thorough, superior level of protection. The XTSL stands out as the only Radian model to include aluminum reinforced head support with adjustable head wings, which enhances safety and provides support for sleeping children.For added safety, the seat is also equipped with a forward- and rear-facing tether system and is the only car seat in the market to offer SafeStop technology, an energy-absorbing harness system.Easy Installation, Portability, and ConvenienceLike many car seats, the Radian allows you to easily install it by engaging the seat's Latch connectors onto a vehicle's Latch bars, which can be found in vehicles built after 2001. For drivers of vehicles without Latch, the good news is that the seat can also be easily installed with the vehicle seatbelt. For cars with Latch, the seat's SuperLATCH system is a prominent feature that offers added convenience and increased safety.What makes the Radian XTSL different? Typical Latch systems have limited weight capacities of 40-48 pounds. Once a child has reached this weight limit, instructions call for the caregiver to unlatch the seat and reinstall it using the car's seatbelt, a method that increases the likelihood of incorrect installations. The XTSL's SuperLATCH system extends that weight limit to 80 pounds. Beyond the added convenience, SuperLATCH also helps increase safety, as a Latch system is an easier installation method with less room for error than using the seatbelt method. Further easing installation is an Easy-Tite adjuster for firm fastening and rubber non-slip grips along the seat bottom to prevent car seat slippage.Because safety is a priority to Sunshine Kids, the Radian not only meets and exceeds US mandated standards, but has also been tested to the more rigorous, yet voluntary NCAP standard which simulates more severe accidents.Of particular convenience to daycare providers and parents of multiple children, the Radian's slim design fits three across in most vehicles, making it ideal for sedans and smaller SUVs. Plus, it still provides ample shoulder room for growing children. Yet another unique feature of this car seat, the Radian is the only convertible car seat on the market that folds flat, so you can store it away and take it along for travel. The Radian XTSL also features a handy padded shoulder strap.Comfort Features for Growing ChildrenThis innovative car seat will grow with your child from infancy to childhood and is designed with several features to ensure your child's comfort, whether you're driving across town to the babysitter's or across the country for the holidays. These comfort features include comfort foam padding, a long seat, adjustable seat positions, and 3-in-1 infant/toddler full body support cushions.Especially pleasant for those long rides, the memory foam padding around the seat, plush fabric, and extended seat bottom combine for an extra comfortable fit. The forward facing position's dual recline angles give two options that are ideal for going from nap time to an upright position without trouble. Additionally, the five harness positions and three buckle positions make it easier than ever to customize the car seat to ensure your child is properly secured as he or she grows.And featuring the two highest weight limits in the market, this convertible car seat is suitable in the rear-facing position from 5 to 45 pounds. When children are old enough, they can be positioned in the forward-facing position up to a weight of 80 pounds. And for easy child-boarding, the seat is designed to sit low on the seat.The car seat is covered with a micro-fiber velour material that comes in a tan and brown color scheme for fashionable families.About the Company: Modern Products for Today's Busy FamiliesSunshine Kids Juvenile Products has over 10 years of experience in designing innovative, thoughtful products that are both safe and convenient.

BALTIC AMBER TEETHING JEWELRY? The Art of Cure Brand AND Trademark is dedicated to providing the highest quality for Teething Babies. Baltic amber Jewelry is made for wearing (not chewing) when a baby is teething to reduce inflammation in the body. The warmth from the skin releases the active ingredient in the Baltic amber, succinic acid. Recent scientific research has proved that succinic acid has a very positive influence on the human body. It improves immunity and the balance of acids when absorbed into the bloodstream; it stimulates the thyroid glands to help reduce drooling when used for teething and soothes red inflamed cheeks. Amber's anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties are recognized by allopathic medicine as a natural analgesic, which will help to relieve teething pain and calm a baby without resorting to drugs. The skin's warmth releases healing oils from the amber, a resin, which is absorbed into the bloodstream. Parent supervision is recommended at all times. They are 12-12.5 in. Packaging is custom from The Art of Cure and comes with a Keepsake pouch. The Art of Cure Baltic Amber is guaranteed to be of the highest quality and made to the best standards.

  "Inspired Ideas BABY CozyWedge Crib Bumper in Blue CozyWedge is a simpler, safer crib bumper with a modern, low profile. Traditional padded bumpers are a hassle to use and studies have shown they can pose a safety risk to young babies. CozyWedge helps address these concerns, and has a fresh, clean design to accent any nursery decor. CozyWedge is made of hard foam inserts in a washable, organic cotton slipcover. It goes around the perimeter of the crib, tying in just six places to stay securely in place. To change the sheets, just untie one side and the whole bumper lifts out for total access to baby's bedding. If baby makes a big mess, the slipcover is machine washable. CozyWedge's unique shape means the pacifier will almost never slip onto the floor in the middle of the night -- so everyone gets a better night's sleep. Many parents like having some kids of bumper in the crib even though studies show traditional bumper pads are not necessary for baby's safety and even present some risks to infants. CozyWedge offers parents an alternative, with a firm surface that won't form a soft pocket around baby's mouth and nose. The low profile helps protect tiny arms and legs from entanglement while allowing far greater visibility into the crib. Experts increasingly recommend frequent checks to see if baby is okay; CozyWedge makes that easy. And because CozyWedge is extremely lightweight, it won't press down on a baby who gets under the bumper.",

  "Philips Avent iQ24 Sterilizer with 2 Bottles, 9 oz Baby care requires so much time and vigilant attention. Any appliance that takes the guesswork (and a few precious minutes) out of the endless feeding routine is a blessing to caregivers. The Avent IQ24 Sterilizer is a relatively small, simple appliance that sterilizes up to six (Avent brand) bottles and/or screw rings, nipples, pacifiers, and breast pump components in just six minutes. The contents then stay sterile for six hours, providing the lid is not removed. An optional second mode keeps bottle- and breastfeeding accessories sterile for up to 24 hours by continuously repeating the cycle, so baby can have clean, sterile bottles day and night. And as we know, babies actively require feeding 24/7, so this is no idle bonus!A Sterilizer with an IQThe Avent iQ24 Electronic Steam Sterilizer is so named because the makers consider it an \"intelligent\" product, using \"advanced iQ technology.\" And it really is pretty smart. The machine communicates each phase of the sterilization cycle, so you never have to guess whether the bottles or breast pump accessories are actually sterile yet. A digital display, electronic countdown, and sound alerts give parents the assurance that baby will not be contaminated with the bacteria that lurk in unclean feeding equipment. Another cool feature is the ability to \"pause\" the cycle (again, read the instructions to do this properly!) in order to remove some items without interrupting the cycle.Putting the Sterilizer TogetherAlthough the iQ24 Sterilizer is relatively easy to assemble and use, it&#x92;s not necessarily intuitive. In other words, you&#x92;re probably going to have to read the instruction manual pretty carefully the first time around. After that, it should be a piece of cake. Basically, there is a pot with power cord, a lower basket, a bottle rack, an upper basket (plus a spare upper basket), a lid, measuring cup, and tongs. Two 9-ounce bottles are included, as well, along with nipples, screw rings, and dome caps. The baskets and bottle rack slide onto a central stem, and the bottles and breast pump components are placed in the appropriate baskets or rack. The sterilizer cleverly uses bottle screw rings to separate the baskets and bottle rack, putting the very items to be sterilized to good secondary use! Once the correct amount of water is added and all parts are assembled and loaded (and that&#x92;s the hardest part, figuring out which basket and bottle parts go where), simply plug the sterilizer body into an electrical outlet, select mode one or two (for six-hour or 24-hour sterilization cycles), and wait six minutes (for either mode). You&#x92;ll also need to study the information pamphlet for a translation of the various beeps and flashing lights on the display, but generally it will be obvious when the sterilization cycle has begun and ended, and what to do next (feed that baby!).Dishwasher BasketAs a bonus feature, two baskets can be clipped together to hold small items such as nipples, breast pump parts, pacifiers, etc., for washing in the top rack of your dishwasher prior to sterilization. Keep in mind that Avent items may discolor over time if they are washed in the dishwasher with dirty dishes covered with remnants of strong sauces, such as tomato or curry sauce.Note: Sterilization is not the same as, nor should it replace, washing! All bottles and breast pump supplies should be washed carefully in mild, soapy water, and rinsed, before sterilizing. Also, for optimal effectiveness of the sterilizer, and to reduce limescale build-up, use distilled water for sterilizing. Regardless of whether you use tap or distilled water, you should de-scale the sterilizer every four weeks or so (read manual for instructions).--Emilie Coulter",

The compact unit travels to and plugs in anywhere&#x97;a bedside table, a nursery, a hotel room, or the babysitter's house, keeping all the feeding accessories close at hand. An insulated cooler on the back of the warmer uses a frozen ice pack (included) to keep two bottles cool for an 8-hour period and is removable for easy transportation. A nightlight provides just enough of a glow to prepare bottles in the dark without waking baby. Bottles fit into a warming chamber on the front of the unit and quickly warm up to the right feeding temperature in just five minutes. A light illuminates when the bottle is ready and, for safety, the warming mechanism automatically shuts off when finished (just in case Mom or baby falls back asleep again). This warmer has two droppers on either side for storing and measuring out water for heating additional bottles. This bottle warmer accepts all bottle types, including angled, disposable, and wide-neck styles, and also heats baby food jars.--Cristina Vaamonde",

  "Britax Marathon in Ashley Floral This LATCH-equipped car seat converts from a rear-facing unit for infants (up to about 30 lbs.), to a forward-facing seat for kids at least a year old (up to 65 lbs.). To that end, the seat necessarily comes with belts, padded harnesses, and tethers--along the groin, waist, and shoulders--to prevent wobbling and leaning, and to allow the seat to be secured in cars that do not accommodate a LATCH system. It is therefore versatile enough for almost any car. Foam padding protects the head and sides, while two reclining positions make the ride even more enjoyable. The one caveat: the seat&#x92;s floral design may match your grandmother&#x92;s upholstered sofa from 20 years ago. But, unlike your grandmother&#x92;s sofa, this seat is not only machine-washable and stain-proofed, it&#x92;s removable and replaceable. Other seat cover designs are sold separately.--Diane Beall",

  "Philips AVENT Newborn Starter Set The key feature of the Philips Avent newborn starter set bottles is the patented anti-colic nipple. It has an anti-vacuum skirt and one-way air valve that reduces air into the baby's stomach, and hence, reduces painful gas and colic. The natural shape and feel of the silicone nipple closely resembles the breast to make it easier to combine bottle and breastfeeding. The wide-neck bottles are easy to refill and clean. The cap seals the nipple to prevent leaking while mixing or traveling. The set includes two 4-oz. and three 9-oz. reusable bottles and five Avent anti-colic nipples, five dome caps, two newborn pacifiers with caps, and a bottle brush. --Scott Teal",

BALTIC AMBER TEETHING JEWELRY? The Art of Cure Brand AND Trademark is dedicated to providing the highest quality for Teething Babies. Baltic amber Jewelry is made for wearing (not chewing) when a baby is teething to reduce inflammation in the body. The warmth from the skin releases the active ingredient in the Baltic amber, succinic acid. Recent scientific research has proved that succinic acid has a very positive influence on the human body. It improves immunity and the balance of acids when absorbed into the bloodstream; it stimulates the thyroid glands to help reduce drooling when used for teething and soothes red inflamed cheeks. Amber's anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties are recognized by allopathic medicine as a natural analgesic, which will help to relieve teething pain and calm a baby without resorting to drugs. The skin's warmth releases healing oils from the amber, a resin, which is absorbed into the bloodstream. Parent supervision is recommended at all times. They are 12-12.5 in. Packaging is custom from The Art of Cure and comes with a Keepsake pouch. The Art of Cure Baltic Amber is guaranteed to be of the highest quality and made to the best standards.

  "The Original Woombie Baby Cocoon Swaddle (Big Baby (14-19 lbs), Aqua Stripe) From Woomb...to Woombie.

Air enters and exits the bottle without mixing with the milk, greatly reducing gas, colic, and messy spit-ups, while also minimizing pressure on your baby's ear canals. The BPA- and Phthalate-free bottle comes in a variety of sizes so your baby can grow with the VentAire system.Easy Cleanup and Convenient, Pre-Calibrated BottlesFor added convenience, the VentAire bottles open at both ends for easy cleaning. The bottles, bottle caps, vent disks, and nipples are safe to wash on the top rack of the dishwasher or can be rinsed with hot, soapy water. Plus, the bottles feature convenient, pre-calibrated markers, so you never have to guess at how much liquid you are giving your baby at each feeding.About Playtex: Thoughtfully Designed Products for Your Little OnesThe Playtex family of baby and toddler products provides invaluable, time-saving products for parents and caregivers.

  "Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper, Green There are baby bouncers, and there are activity centers -- and then, there's the Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper, which combines both concepts in one fun, convenient, and economical toy.

It stands on a base, with the infant bucket seat attached to two arches by adjustable, spring-loaded straps. When baby is placed in the seat, he can kick off the ground with his legs to bounce up and down. This provides vital exercise for a youngster's legs, helping to prepare him for walking. The six-point height adjustment lets it grow with your infant, while non-skid feet and fabric-covered springs keep baby safe.Most bouncers stop there -- but we're delighted to find that the Activity Jumper also surrounds baby with plenty of fun, interactive toys. The bucket seat can rotate 360 degrees for baby to reach all of the activities. He'll delight in the frog spinner, bead chaser, and baby-proof mirror. The toy also includes 10 Baby Einstein links that can be repositioned and detached from the activity center for on-the-go play, or which serve as attachment points for additional toys.A teether stalk toy helps soothe itchy gums while encouraging \"reach and grab\" coordination. And the light-up piano keys give baby an interactive introduction to musical creativity with two modes: the \"piano notes\" mode plays in piano tones, while the \"melodies\" mode features five classical melodies.Help Your Little One Get StrongerBabies love bouncing. Not only is it exciting for a baby to move himself with the power of his own legs, but it gives him satisfying, and vital, exercise that helps prepare him for standing and walking. The higher and harder that baby bounces in the Activity Jumper, the more the toys will rattle and shake -- making it even more exciting and fun. And with the added benefit of a rotating seat, which baby operates by pushing off the ground with his feet, your infant gets even more leg coordination practice in a safe, secure place. We especially enjoy the versatility of this 2-for-1 toy -- and it's safer than an infant walker.Other perks for parents: the fabric seat cover is a cinch to remove, and it's machine washable. And unlike some other bouncers, the Activity Jumper folds down flat for much easier storage. While it's erected, however, it takes up a bit of room. And because your baby won't be able to use this toy once he's able to stand and walk unassisted, it has a limited-use timeframe.What's in the BoxActivity jumper, assembly hardware, quick start guide, and user's guide.",

  "The Floppy Seat: Deluxe Shopping Cart Seat Cover with EZ Carry Storage Bag! For the baby who has everything&#x85; The Floppy Seat at first glance might seem like baby gear marketing gone wild.

The stretchable non-toxic Snappi hooks into the diaper material to make a strong closure. They work best with diapers that have a loose enough weave for the Snappi to hook into. (Snappi terry cloth diapers, cotton pre-folds, and others) Note they do not work well with flannel or other tightly woven diapers.\n\nHow to use your Snappi:\n\nTo improve elasticity, stretch your Snappi fastener a few times before use.\n\nStep 1: Hook left\n\nStep 2: Stretch across and hook right\n\nStep 3: Stretch down and hook center\n\nThe Snappi should go from a \"T\" shape to a \"Y\" shape when stretched properly.\n\nWarning: Always use a cover over a Snappi fastener. Keep out of children's reach when not in use. Do not use a Snappi fastener on toddlers that have the ability to undo or take off their cover/diaper/clothes. Do not use your Snappi for longer than 6 months. Not UV resistant - exposure to the sun can reduce the effectiveness of the Snappi.\n\nCAUTION: Any tear in the Snappi can lead to separation of a piece, presenting a possible choking hazard. Inspect the Snappi before each use and discontinue using immediately if there is any sign of cracking, tearing, breakage or wear of the teeth or any other parts. Do not cut a Snappi as this may cause tearing.",

  "Miracle Blanket Green With Beige Trim At last, the perfect swaddle made easy!\n\nMiracle Blanket earned the \"thumbs up\" from the Good Housekeeping Institute. Uses no velcro, zippers or other confusing adjustments that can scratch baby and one size fits all. New research shows the benefits of swaddling to calm baby and help ensure longer sleep but the Miracle Blanket makes it easy. It truly is amazing. The Miracle Blanket is made of the highest quality (and cozy) materials available and is stitched with great attention to detail. The Miracle Blanket helps baby sleep on his back to reduce SIDS concerns and clinical studies prove that proper swaddling can often eliminate colic symptoms. Yet most blankets do not provide for a secure swaddle and baby often manages to squirm loose. The Miracle Blanket is easy to use and keeps baby snug. Pediatrician recommended.\n\nWhat are parents saying?\n\"I love this blanket! It has saved me countless hours of sleep and crying. I recommend it to all of my expecting friends in my playgroup.\" -- Sharon - MN\n\n\"I was at my wits end when I was introduced to the Miracle Blanket. The first night that I used the blanket, Makena slept four straight hours. By the third night of use she slept six straight hours. This blanket is a lifesaver!\" Heather Brady - CA\n\nWhat do the pros say?\n\"...Our more experienced maternity ward nurses were skeptical at first, but now even THEY are asking for more! The new parents ay it's a Miracle!\" Director of Women's a Children's Services at UCLA Medical Center\n\n\"We just put our one month old son down for the second night wrapped in The Miracle Blanket.

Framed with steel alloy for safety, the seat offers side-impact protection with aluminum-reinforced sides, energy-absorbing EPS foam, and reinforced head support with adjustable head wings. Plus, it installs easily, thanks to a SuperLATCH system with a market-leading capacity of 80 pounds. The XTSL also boasts a handy padded shoulder strap, plush fabric, memory foam for superior comfort, and 3-in-1 infant/toddler full body support cushions.Radian XTSL ConvertibleCar SeatAt a Glance:Rating:Rear-facing position from 5 - 45 pounds; forward-facing up to 80 poundsIt is recommended to keep children rear facing as long as possibleIt is recommended to keep children in a 5 pt harness as long as possibleThe seat offers side-impact protection with aluminum-reinforced sides and energy-absorbing EPS foam.View larger.The XTSL features the highest weight limits in the market.The seat folds flat, so you can store it away or take it along for travel.(Shown here in Eclipse style.)View larger.Steel Frame and Side Impact ProtectionThe Radian XTSL Convertible Car Seat is constructed with a steel alloy frame for ultimate safety and strength, providing security for your child and peace of mind for you. The seat's side impact protection features include aluminum-reinforced sides and energy-absorbing EPS foam, which work together to protect the child's head and body and provide a thorough, superior level of protection. The XTSL stands out as the only Radian model to include aluminum reinforced head support with adjustable head wings, which enhances safety and provides support for sleeping children.For added safety, the seat is also equipped with a forward- and rear-facing tether system and is the only car seat in the market to offer SafeStop technology, an energy-absorbing harness system.Easy Installation, Portability, and ConvenienceLike many car seats, the Radian allows you to easily install it by engaging the seat's Latch connectors onto a vehicle's Latch bars, which can be found in vehicles built after 2001. For drivers of vehicles without Latch, the good news is that the seat can also be easily installed with the vehicle seatbelt. For cars with Latch, the seat's SuperLATCH system is a prominent feature that offers added convenience and increased safety.What makes the Radian XTSL different? Typical Latch systems have limited weight capacities of 40-48 pounds. Once a child has reached this weight limit, instructions call for the caregiver to unlatch the seat and reinstall it using the car's seatbelt, a method that increases the likelihood of incorrect installations. The XTSL's SuperLATCH system extends that weight limit to 80 pounds. Beyond the added convenience, SuperLATCH also helps increase safety, as a Latch system is an easier installation method with less room for error than using the seatbelt method. Further easing installation is an Easy-Tite adjuster for firm fastening and rubber non-slip grips along the seat bottom to prevent car seat slippage.Because safety is a priority to Sunshine Kids, the Radian not only meets and exceeds US mandated standards, but has also been tested to the more rigorous, yet voluntary NCAP standard which simulates more severe accidents.Of particular convenience to daycare providers and parents of multiple children, the Radian's slim design fits three across in most vehicles, making it ideal for sedans and smaller SUVs. Plus, it still provides ample shoulder room for growing children. Yet another unique feature of this car seat, the Radian is the only convertible car seat on the market that folds flat, so you can store it away and take it along for travel. The Radian XTSL also features a handy padded shoulder strap.Comfort Features for Growing ChildrenThis innovative car seat will grow with your child from infancy to childhood and is designed with several features to ensure your child's comfort, whether you're driving across town to the babysitter's or across the country for the holidays. These comfort features include comfort foam padding, a long seat, adjustable seat positions, and 3-in-1 infant/toddler full body support cushions.Especially pleasant for those long rides, the memory foam padding around the seat, plush fabric, and extended seat bottom combine for an extra comfortable fit. The forward facing position's dual recline angles give two options that are ideal for going from nap time to an upright position without trouble. Additionally, the five harness positions and three buckle positions make it easier than ever to customize the car seat to ensure your child is properly secured as he or she grows.And featuring the two highest weight limits in the market, this convertible car seat is suitable in the rear-facing position from 5 to 45 pounds. When children are old enough, they can be positioned in the forward-facing position up to a weight of 80 pounds. And for easy child-boarding, the seat is designed to sit low on the seat.The car seat is covered with a micro-fiber velour material that comes in a tan and brown color scheme for fashionable families.About the Company: Modern Products for Today's Busy FamiliesSunshine Kids Juvenile Products has over 10 years of experience in designing innovative, thoughtful products that are both safe and convenient.

The base of the machine houses the induction heater and offers whisk storage and a cord wrap on the bottom for tangle-free storage when not in use.

  "Easy Stroll One Handed Stroller Grip, Black Easy Stroll works on most strollers that have standard handles with rubber or foam hand grips. Easy Stroll does not work with umbrella type stroller handles, pistol grip handles, or strollers with hard plastic hand grips. One hand operation of a stroller is now possible with Easy Stroll. Previously, pushing a stroller with one hand was cumbersome at best. And, if you were successful, it usually resulted in a sore arm or a sore back for days. Now, all of that has changed. With Easy Stroll, there is little need to use arm or back strength at all. Instead, leverage does the work for you. Simply change the direction you're walking and the stroller will effortlessly change a directions with you. To turn the stroller to the right, walk slightly to the left. The leverage of your entire body will easily turn the stroller to the right. Some of the control still comes from your arms, but most of the control comes from moving your feet. After a short period of time, the operation of the stroller becomes second nature and your strolling will never be the same. In addition to the control it provides, easy stroll is an ergonomic stroller handle that promotes proper posture. Baby strollers without Easy Stroll, require two hands for operation. This in turn requires \"hunching\" over the stroller, which puts an unnatural curve in your spine. Unfortunately, these improper body mechanics are unavoidable when pushing a stroller with two hands. Using single handed operation, Easy Stroll straightens your back and allows for a \"normal\" walking posture when pushing a stroller. As a result, the operator experiences no arm or back strain.",

BALTIC AMBER TEETHING JEWELRY? The Art of Cure Brand AND Trademark is dedicated to providing the highest quality for Teething Babies. Baltic amber Jewelry is made for wearing (not chewing) when a baby is teething to reduce inflammation in the body. The warmth from the skin releases the active ingredient in the Baltic amber, succinic acid. Recent scientific research has proved that succinic acid has a very positive influence on the human body. It improves immunity and the balance of acids when absorbed into the bloodstream; it stimulates the thyroid glands to help reduce drooling when used for teething and soothes red inflamed cheeks. Amber's anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties are recognized by allopathic medicine as a natural analgesic, which will help to relieve teething pain and calm a baby without resorting to drugs. The skin's warmth releases healing oils from the amber, a resin, which is absorbed into the bloodstream. Parent supervision is recommended at all times. They are 12-12.5 in. Packaging is custom from The Art of Cure and comes with a Keepsake pouch. The Art of Cure Baltic Amber is guaranteed to be of the highest quality and made to the best standards.

During the first months of life, babies learn how to move their bodies and gain the necessary physical strength for rolling over, sitting up, and crawling. Besides the physical benefits of tummy time, giving your infant playtime on his belly will help minimize any flat spots on his head that may have come from sleeping on his back.The Spin and Explore offers both you and your baby a soft and safe space to make tummy time a pleasurable part of everyday activities. Baby can gently and comfortably spin around on her tummy, stretching and strengthening her upper and lower body while enjoying lots of squeaky, crinkly, tactile fun. After your baby can sit up on her own, you can remove the spinner and let her take advantage of the other visually and physically stimulating features, like the peek-a-boo leaf flap and mirror.Fun, Innovative DesignWinner of Redbook's \"Hottest Toys of the 2007 Holiday Season,\" and a Toy Insider 2007 Top 20 pick, the Spin and Explore provides an innovative platform with a unique shape and rotating motion to encourage exploration and give babies the confidence they need to try new things. As his coordination grows, baby is more likely to want to attempt new skills--like twirling around on his tummy to visit his garden pals for tactile play, interaction that motivates him to hold his head up, use his legs, and spin on his stomach.The Spin and Explore can be used with or without the platform and also includes little loops to attach other toys to the play mat.

  "Thirsties Duo Hemp Prefold, White, Size One (6-18 lbs) Thirsties is revolutionizing the most widely used cloth diaper in the world. Prefold cloth diapers are popular for their affordability and are the most common diaper supplied by cloth diaper services. Though they don't share all the bells and whistles as other more modern cloth diapers, they have their definite and permanent place in the industry and they have been proven dependable and economical. However, Thirsties Duo Hemp Prefolds are no ordinary prefold. We've solved many of the cons of prefold diapers in our patent-pending design. Ordinary prefolds are bulky and take a long time to dry. When hung to dry, they can become stiff and crunchy. In addition, most prefolds are 8 layers thick in the middle, which makes it difficult to clean all layers of the diaper thoroughly. Thirsties Duo Hemp Prefolds are designed to allow air flow and each panel is only 2 layers thick which allows for thorough cleansing with little effort and quick drying times. Our custom hemp jersey is as soft as your favorite t-shirt and it knitted with love right here in the USA. In fact, our hemp jersey is 25% more absorbent than a prefold of the same weight made from cotton alone. This translates into a very trim and effective cloth diaper with a hefty amount of absorbing power. Made in USA",

  "BabyMoon Pod - For Head Support &amp; Neck Support (Blue) The Babymoon Pod is designed as a head support to help prevent Flat Head Syndrome (plagiocephaly) for babies from 0-6 months, and for neck support from 6-12 months. Its unique functionality allows it to be used as a head support or neck support by attaching or detaching the two arms. The two arms can be attached to make a head support by overlapping the ends of the right arm (Velcro arm) and the left arm. The Velcro under the right arm sticks to the white portion on the upper side of the left arm to create a secure attachment which prevents the head from falling through the opening. The circular opening of the pod cradles the back of the head while providing comfortable placement and optimal positioning. The length of the white portion allows the pod to be adjusted to various sizes.  Neck Support - Recommended for 6 Months to 12 Months. Once the two arms are detached, the Velcro should be covered with the Peak-a-Boo cover located on the upper side of the right arm. The Peak-a-Boo cover is the self-fabric flap which should be turned inside out to hide the Velcro in order to avoid irritation to the skin.  Babymoon Pod has been tested under a reasonable program of testing (including testing by a certified third-party laboratory where required) and the Babymoon Pod complies with all Federal and state consumer product safety rules, bans, standards or regulations applicable to the Babymoon Pod.  Babymoon Pod size: 10\\\" x 10\\\" x 3\\\" (can be adjusted smaller). Choice of Babymoon Pod covers in either minky soft 100% polyester or 100% cotton.

  "Peewees Disposable Multi-Use Pads - 36 Pack These disposable pads make it easy to follow the practice of   \"cloth at home, disposables on the go.\" The pads are similar to the  blue towels pinned under your chin at the dentist, but are soft,  absorbent, and waterproof. No more carrying around dirty towels in your  diaper bag! We tested the absorption by slowly pouring 2 ounces of  water onto the pad (simulating a diaper-changing accident), and were  impressed at how well the liquid was wicked away and absorbed. The  waterproof backing kept the work surface completely dry. At 13 by 19  inches, it's easy to use them for more than just diaper changes: use as  a burping pad over the shoulder or on the lap, in the stroller or  carriage, to prevent snack messes, under the highchair, or between the  car seat and the car door. Use them at home, too, to reduce laundry.--Terri Shea",

  "Philips Avent iQ24 Sterilizer with 2 Bottles, 9 oz Baby care requires so much time and vigilant attention. Any appliance that takes the guesswork (and a few precious minutes) out of the endless feeding routine is a blessing to caregivers. The Avent IQ24 Sterilizer is a relatively small, simple appliance that sterilizes up to six (Avent brand) bottles and/or screw rings, nipples, pacifiers, and breast pump components in just six minutes. The contents then stay sterile for six hours, providing the lid is not removed. An optional second mode keeps bottle- and breastfeeding accessories sterile for up to 24 hours by continuously repeating the cycle, so baby can have clean, sterile bottles day and night. And as we know, babies actively require feeding 24/7, so this is no idle bonus!A Sterilizer with an IQThe Avent iQ24 Electronic Steam Sterilizer is so named because the makers consider it an \"intelligent\" product, using \"advanced iQ technology.\" And it really is pretty smart. The machine communicates each phase of the sterilization cycle, so you never have to guess whether the bottles or breast pump accessories are actually sterile yet. A digital display, electronic countdown, and sound alerts give parents the assurance that baby will not be contaminated with the bacteria that lurk in unclean feeding equipment. Another cool feature is the ability to \"pause\" the cycle (again, read the instructions to do this properly!) in order to remove some items without interrupting the cycle.Putting the Sterilizer TogetherAlthough the iQ24 Sterilizer is relatively easy to assemble and use, it&#x92;s not necessarily intuitive. In other words, you&#x92;re probably going to have to read the instruction manual pretty carefully the first time around. After that, it should be a piece of cake. Basically, there is a pot with power cord, a lower basket, a bottle rack, an upper basket (plus a spare upper basket), a lid, measuring cup, and tongs. Two 9-ounce bottles are included, as well, along with nipples, screw rings, and dome caps. The baskets and bottle rack slide onto a central stem, and the bottles and breast pump components are placed in the appropriate baskets or rack. The sterilizer cleverly uses bottle screw rings to separate the baskets and bottle rack, putting the very items to be sterilized to good secondary use! Once the correct amount of water is added and all parts are assembled and loaded (and that&#x92;s the hardest part, figuring out which basket and bottle parts go where), simply plug the sterilizer body into an electrical outlet, select mode one or two (for six-hour or 24-hour sterilization cycles), and wait six minutes (for either mode). You&#x92;ll also need to study the information pamphlet for a translation of the various beeps and flashing lights on the display, but generally it will be obvious when the sterilization cycle has begun and ended, and what to do next (feed that baby!).Dishwasher BasketAs a bonus feature, two baskets can be clipped together to hold small items such as nipples, breast pump parts, pacifiers, etc., for washing in the top rack of your dishwasher prior to sterilization. Keep in mind that Avent items may discolor over time if they are washed in the dishwasher with dirty dishes covered with remnants of strong sauces, such as tomato or curry sauce.Note: Sterilization is not the same as, nor should it replace, washing! All bottles and breast pump supplies should be washed carefully in mild, soapy water, and rinsed, before sterilizing. Also, for optimal effectiveness of the sterilizer, and to reduce limescale build-up, use distilled water for sterilizing. Regardless of whether you use tap or distilled water, you should de-scale the sterilizer every four weeks or so (read manual for instructions).--Emilie Coulter",

It stands on a base, with the infant bucket seat attached to two arches by adjustable, spring-loaded straps. When baby is placed in the seat, he can kick off the ground with his legs to bounce up and down. This provides vital exercise for a youngster's legs, helping to prepare him for walking. The six-point height adjustment lets it grow with your infant, while non-skid feet and fabric-covered springs keep baby safe.Most bouncers stop there -- but we're delighted to find that the Activity Jumper also surrounds baby with plenty of fun, interactive toys. The bucket seat can rotate 360 degrees for baby to reach all of the activities. He'll delight in the frog spinner, bead chaser, and baby-proof mirror. The toy also includes 10 Baby Einstein links that can be repositioned and detached from the activity center for on-the-go play, or which serve as attachment points for additional toys.A teether stalk toy helps soothe itchy gums while encouraging \"reach and grab\" coordination. And the light-up piano keys give baby an interactive introduction to musical creativity with two modes: the \"piano notes\" mode plays in piano tones, while the \"melodies\" mode features five classical melodies.Help Your Little One Get StrongerBabies love bouncing. Not only is it exciting for a baby to move himself with the power of his own legs, but it gives him satisfying, and vital, exercise that helps prepare him for standing and walking. The higher and harder that baby bounces in the Activity Jumper, the more the toys will rattle and shake -- making it even more exciting and fun. And with the added benefit of a rotating seat, which baby operates by pushing off the ground with his feet, your infant gets even more leg coordination practice in a safe, secure place. We especially enjoy the versatility of this 2-for-1 toy -- and it's safer than an infant walker.Other perks for parents: the fabric seat cover is a cinch to remove, and it's machine washable. And unlike some other bouncers, the Activity Jumper folds down flat for much easier storage. While it's erected, however, it takes up a bit of room. And because your baby won't be able to use this toy once he's able to stand and walk unassisted, it has a limited-use timeframe.What's in the BoxActivity jumper, assembly hardware, quick start guide, and user's guide.",

  "Miracle Blanket Green With Beige Trim At last, the perfect swaddle made easy!\n\nMiracle Blanket earned the \"thumbs up\" from the Good Housekeeping Institute.

  "Bummis TotsBots Easy Fit Hook &amp; Loop Cloth Diaper Shell, Chicken Little, One Size 8-35 lbs From the Manufacturer: The New Easy Fit combines the convenience of a one-size all-in-one diaper with the benefits of a 2-piece diaper: easy to care for and quick to dry. It's the best of both worlds! No assembly required! This innovative diaper has a fold-out liner, which makes it very easy to stuff. But don't worry about unstuffing - the agitation in your washing machine will work the liner out of the pocket, so there's no need to get your hands dirty! The liner is made of three layers of soft minky fabric: it absorbs quickly, and it absorbs a LOT. The liner can be folded to create more layers where more absorption is needed, or to reduce bulk if desired. Bonus: minky dries VERY quickly, so after the wash is done, these diapers will be back on baby's bum in no time. This is a diaper engineered for successful leak containment and total convenience. With a wider elastic in the back and a stretchy waist, the New Easy Fit offers great protection, and a super comfy fit too. The New Easy Fit is colour-coordinated for a sleeker look.

Using Bottle Buddy to make up a feeding is convenient, quick and easy to use and, most importantly, it saves time and ensures that every bottle contains the right amount of formula every time. It&#x2019;s a common, yet annoying, mistake to make: you're preparing a bottle for your baby and counting the amount of powder into the bottle when someone or something interrupts you. Before you know it, you&#x2019;re wondering: &#x201C;was that five or six scoops?&#x201D; and have to start over again. Bottle Buddy eliminates the risk of contamination, human error and spillage by delivering an adjustable, preset, consistent quantity of powder at a touch of a button. Bottle Buddy is ideal for new parents or caretakers who may be nervous about formula quantities. Bottle Buddy is set to revolutionize the way parents make up their babies' bottles forever. Benefits Breast milk is generally thought to be best for babies but there are a number of good reasons why many mothers choose to bottle feed from birth or only breast feed for a short while. Some parents supplement breast milk with powdered infant or follow-on formula - especially as the baby gets older. Whatever they choose, all parents want to see their baby thrive and grow at a healthy rate. On average, parents put over 10,000 scoops of infant or follow-on formula into bottles in the first year of a baby&#x2019;s life. It is not only very time consuming but also very easy to miscount the amount of formula used, especially when holding a crying, hungry baby and trying to make up a bottle at the same time. Using Bottle Buddy to make up a feeding ensures that every bottle contains the correct amount of formula and overcomes some of the serious health risks associated with formula feeding. Miscounting scoops, overfeeding or underfeeding on a regular basis can have long-term health implications.",

  "Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, 2008 The world's first Newborn Soothing Center, Graco&#x92;s Sweetpeace uses patented motion with four seating positions to create the perfect resting place for baby. Distinct sensations recreate a mother's movements and address the multi-sensory needs of infants. Developed with significant scientific research, the Sweetpeace calms baby via four of the senses: sight, sound, scent, and touch.Sight: Because newborns need visual simplicity, the Sweetpeace is made with neutral colors for a calming effect, has an adjustable canopy to control incoming light, and hosts a mirror that helps baby settle by focusing on their reflection.Sound: Comforting, low-frequency sounds recreate the in utero experience, while high-quality music offers sleepy songs for quiet times or upbeat songs for alert times. There is also a nature sounds (wind, rain, ocean waves) option, or an MP3 plug-in connection and holder allows you to create baby&#x92;s customized playlist.Scent: A parent&#x92;s scent is most recognizable and soothing to baby. The Sweetpeace includes removable soft components (a swaddling blanket and head support) that can be infused with nature&#x92;s \"aromatherapy\" and calm baby with the familiar smells.Touch: A 2-speed vibration calms and relaxes with a subtle \"massage\" while the 5-point harness offers gentle ventral pressure that simulates \"hugging.\" The Soothing Center also moves like mothers do. It has four unique seating positions that imitate how you hold baby, four cradling motions, three recline positions, and six speeds that can be adjusted to baby&#x92;s mood.No tools are necessary to assemble the Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center.Babies (and parents) are calmed by the Sweetpeace&#x92;s multi-sensory technology.As if all of this wasn&#x92;t enough to make you wish you had one of these when you were a baby, Graco threw in some other thoughtful features. The removable seat doubles as an infant carrier or a floor rocker. On the flip side, the Soothing Center&#x92;s frame is car seat-compatible and accepts all Graco infant car seats. No tools are required to assemble the Sweetpeace. The device can be operated using the included AC adaptor or it can function on five D batteries (not included) should you be someplace without an available socket.

BALTIC AMBER TEETHING JEWELRY? The Art of Cure Brand AND Trademark is dedicated to providing the highest quality for Teething Babies. Baltic amber Jewelry is made for wearing (not chewing) when a baby is teething to reduce inflammation in the body. The warmth from the skin releases the active ingredient in the Baltic amber, succinic acid. Recent scientific research has proved that succinic acid has a very positive influence on the human body. It improves immunity and the balance of acids when absorbed into the bloodstream; it stimulates the thyroid glands to help reduce drooling when used for teething and soothes red inflamed cheeks. Amber's anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties are recognized by allopathic medicine as a natural analgesic, which will help to relieve teething pain and calm a baby without resorting to drugs. The skin's warmth releases healing oils from the amber, a resin, which is absorbed into the bloodstream. Parent supervision is recommended at all times. They are 12-12.5 in. Packaging is custom from The Art of Cure and comes with a Keepsake pouch. The Art of Cure Baltic Amber is guaranteed to be of the highest quality and made to the best standards.

Framed with steel alloy for safety, the seat offers side-impact protection with aluminum-reinforced sides, energy-absorbing EPS foam, and reinforced head support with adjustable head wings. Plus, it installs easily, thanks to a SuperLATCH system with a market-leading capacity of 80 pounds. The XTSL also boasts a handy padded shoulder strap, plush fabric, memory foam for superior comfort, and 3-in-1 infant/toddler full body support cushions.Radian XTSL ConvertibleCar SeatAt a Glance:Rating:Rear-facing position from 5 - 45 pounds; forward-facing up to 80 poundsIt is recommended to keep children rear facing as long as possibleIt is recommended to keep children in a 5 pt harness as long as possibleThe seat offers side-impact protection with aluminum-reinforced sides and energy-absorbing EPS foam.View larger.The XTSL features the highest weight limits in the market.The seat folds flat, so you can store it away or take it along for travel.(Shown here in Eclipse style.)View larger.Steel Frame and Side Impact ProtectionThe Radian XTSL Convertible Car Seat is constructed with a steel alloy frame for ultimate safety and strength, providing security for your child and peace of mind for you. The seat's side impact protection features include aluminum-reinforced sides and energy-absorbing EPS foam, which work together to protect the child's head and body and provide a thorough, superior level of protection. The XTSL stands out as the only Radian model to include aluminum reinforced head support with adjustable head wings, which enhances safety and provides support for sleeping children.For added safety, the seat is also equipped with a forward- and rear-facing tether system and is the only car seat in the market to offer SafeStop technology, an energy-absorbing harness system.Easy Installation, Portability, and ConvenienceLike many car seats, the Radian allows you to easily install it by engaging the seat's Latch connectors onto a vehicle's Latch bars, which can be found in vehicles built after 2001. For drivers of vehicles without Latch, the good news is that the seat can also be easily installed with the vehicle seatbelt. For cars with Latch, the seat's SuperLATCH system is a prominent feature that offers added convenience and increased safety.What makes the Radian XTSL different? Typical Latch systems have limited weight capacities of 40-48 pounds. Once a child has reached this weight limit, instructions call for the caregiver to unlatch the seat and reinstall it using the car's seatbelt, a method that increases the likelihood of incorrect installations. The XTSL's SuperLATCH system extends that weight limit to 80 pounds. Beyond the added convenience, SuperLATCH also helps increase safety, as a Latch system is an easier installation method with less room for error than using the seatbelt method. Further easing installation is an Easy-Tite adjuster for firm fastening and rubber non-slip grips along the seat bottom to prevent car seat slippage.Because safety is a priority to Sunshine Kids, the Radian not only meets and exceeds US mandated standards, but has also been tested to the more rigorous, yet voluntary NCAP standard which simulates more severe accidents.Of particular convenience to daycare providers and parents of multiple children, the Radian's slim design fits three across in most vehicles, making it ideal for sedans and smaller SUVs. Plus, it still provides ample shoulder room for growing children. Yet another unique feature of this car seat, the Radian is the only convertible car seat on the market that folds flat, so you can store it away and take it along for travel. The Radian XTSL also features a handy padded shoulder strap.Comfort Features for Growing ChildrenThis innovative car seat will grow with your child from infancy to childhood and is designed with several features to ensure your child's comfort, whether you're driving across town to the babysitter's or across the country for the holidays. These comfort features include comfort foam padding, a long seat, adjustable seat positions, and 3-in-1 infant/toddler full body support cushions.Especially pleasant for those long rides, the memory foam padding around the seat, plush fabric, and extended seat bottom combine for an extra comfortable fit. The forward facing position's dual recline angles give two options that are ideal for going from nap time to an upright position without trouble. Additionally, the five harness positions and three buckle positions make it easier than ever to customize the car seat to ensure your child is properly secured as he or she grows.And featuring the two highest weight limits in the market, this convertible car seat is suitable in the rear-facing position from 5 to 45 pounds. When children are old enough, they can be positioned in the forward-facing position up to a weight of 80 pounds.

  "Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer Bleary-eyed parents who scramble to heat bottles in the middle of the night while their baby screams will rejoice at the simplicity and speed with which the Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer warms milk (and food) to just the right temperature. All they need to do is place the filled bottle in the warmer, fill the warmer with water, plug in, and wait for the neon light to flash on and off. In four to six minutes, baby has his bottle.The DetailsWhether a parent is heating breastmilk, formula, or pureed peas; using Avent bottles, other brands, or baby food jars; the Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer gently and evenly heats baby&#x92;s meal. The included plastic basket is used inside the warmer to keep baby food jars and Avent bottles upright. It can be removed when heating the Avent Magic cup and other makes of bottles. Water is added to just above the level of the milk in the bottle (or below the top of baby food jar). Plug the unit into an electrical outlet and click the switch on. A neon light will illuminate. Turn the dial to the appropriate setting (3 for Avent feeding bottles and baby food jars, and 2 for Avent Disposable System). When the bottle has been in the warmer for the appropriate length of time (a guide is included, based on whether the bottle is at room temperature or refrigerated to start), the light will flash. Test the temperature and reheat if necessary or serve.Don&#x92;t forget to switch the warmer off and unplug it!Why Not Just Use the Microwave?The microwave is never recommended for heating baby bottles or food. It&#x92;s difficult to judge just how much time is needed, and even brief heating can create \"hot spots,\" which can burn baby. In addition, important nutrients may be lost in microwave heating.How About Just Putting the Bottle in a Bowl of Warm Water?Sure, if you (and your baby) don&#x92;t mind standing by the sink waiting for the water from the tap to warm up, then waiting for the bottle to warm, checking, checking again, and again&#x85;Get Out of the KitchenMidnight runs back and forth to the kitchen are not high on the list of favorite activities for most parents. A pleasant bonus to using the Avent Express Warmer is that it can be set up in the bedroom, bathroom, nursery&#x85;anywhere there is an outlet. Having the bottle warmer and fixings set up close to the action (not too close, though&#x97;mind the safety precautions) can subtract minutes from the whole process. And as any parent will tell you, every minute counts.What&#x92;s in the BoxThe Avent Express warming system includes bottle-warming unit, basket, feeding spoon, four-ounce Avent bottle with top (nipple not included), and instruction manual with time/temperature guide. All Avent products work together and are completely interchangeable.Note: It is possible to overheat a bottle or jar of food with this system. If you find that a bottle is not warm enough after the allotted time, you may replace it in the warmer, but remember that, although the water surrounding the bottle will remain at a constant temperature, the contents of the bottle or jar will continue to heat. Always test the milk or food before feeding baby. Use all normal and necessary safeguards when using this electrical appliance.--Emilie Coulter",

Fun for babies and parents, Walk Mee is the best way to teach your baby how to walk.UAB Medicine states that baby walkers have killed more than 34 children since 1974 and in the year 2000, more than 8,300 children were treated for baby walker injuries. Baby walkers cause more injuries than any other type of baby product and baby walker related injuries occur more often in children between the ages of 5 months and 15 months. Baby walkers are dangerous because they allow children access to areas in the house that they might not have access to otherwise. They allow children to reach for items off of countertops and tables that may fall on or cause harm to the child. Children can also fall down steps or stairs while in a baby walker, causing significant injury.",

Baltic amber Jewelry is made for wearing (not chewing) when a baby is teething to reduce inflammation in the body.

It improves immunity and the balance of acids when absorbed into the bloodstream; it stimulates the thyroid glands to help reduce drooling when used for teething and soothes red inflamed cheeks. Amber's anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties are recognized by allopathic medicine as a natural analgesic, which will help to relieve teething pain and calm a baby without resorting to drugs. The skin's warmth releases healing oils from the amber, a resin, which is absorbed into the bloodstream. Parent supervision is recommended at all times. They are 12-12.5 in.

  "The First Years Close and Secure Sleeper The First Years deceptively simple Close & Secure Sleeper allows you to feed, soothe, monitor, and bond with baby in the comfort of your own bed. Meant to be used from birth until baby rolls over or pushes up on their own, the sleeper is anchored to your bed by a large flap that tucks under your mattress. The patented Airflow design of the hollow frame and breathable mesh fabric keep air circulating and baby cool.The sleeper folds up nicely for convenient portability and compact storage.A durable, cloth-covered U-shaped \"wall\" surrounds baby&#x92;s head and torso to limit their movement and help prevent parents from rolling onto them. The soft head barrier reduces the risk of entrapment, while the foot wedge--which can be used as a sleep positioner in future months--ensures baby stays snugly inside the sleep area. The supportive bottom is a cozy resting spot with the included soft cover, vinyl covered mattress, and removable, machine washable mattress sheet.Reassurance and safety weren&#x92;t the only things The First Years folks thought of when creating this sleeper. Other benefits include its portability, a nightlight, and transitional use. For travel convenience, the Close & Secure folds up easily, is lightweight, and sports a carrying handle. Once baby has outgrown it, this feature means that it can also be compactly stored until needed again. A built-in nightlight allows you to quietly check on your bundle of joy during the night and provides enough illumination for feedings without waking your partner. When you are ready to transition baby to the crib, this sleeper can go with them--simply place it in the crib until baby is used to their new setting.Two AA batteries are required for the nightlight.",

  "Cosco Portable Crib - White At a distance, this portable crib could be mistaken for the  permanent variety. Up close, it's clearly something else: a smaller  item altogether, with a 2-inch mattress and board that lift out and two  locking latches. Pop the latches, and in less than a minute the whole  thing folds up to a mere 6 inches wide. In this configuration, it can  still be rolled on the four plastic casters (if care is taken that it  doesn't fall over). Two of the casters lock. Although the board and  mattress can be stored inside the folded frame, it's a pity the board  isn't simply hinged, as in some competing models; this would make setup  and storage slightly easier (and it would make dropping the board on a  toe more difficult). Also, the locking latches are a little hard to  figure out the first time; we've seen more traditional hardware that's  simpler, equally safe, and easier to use.--Richard Farr",

  "Squatty Potty 9&quot; Toilet Stool-Elimination Aid - Natural Bathroom Relief Through A Toilet Stool Made in the USA! The Squatty Potty is a wonderful health aid for the entire family. The Squatty Potty helps you to eliminate faster and more complete by putting your body into a natural squatting position over your own toilet. Using the Squatty Potty during elimination will un-kink your rectum taking your body from a continent mode to an elimination mode. This will speed up the elimination process therefore reducing the risk of toxic build up of fecal matter left in your colon. Using the squatty potty for elimination will reduce straining and decreases the pressure in the anal and rectal veins. The reduction of straining will help to heal and prevent hemorrhoids. It will also reduce the risk of bowel herniation and other damage to the lower digestive tract. The Squatty Potty is attractive and will discretely tuck under your toilet bowl when not in use. Its designed with a forward slant to ergonomically align the body for a comfortable and complete elimination.  Children love the Squatty Potty. It is an excellent toilet training aid.

It is 9 3/4\" high at the back and has a slight forward slope to 8 3/4\" in the front.

If your toilet is 14\"-15\", from the floor to the rim of the toilet seat, or shorter you will want the 7\" to fit properly under the toilet.  If your toilet is 15 1/2\" or taller and your are fairly limber then the 9\" should work good for you.\nIf you are not happy with the squatty potty you can send it back for a refund  (shipping not included in refund)",

The Art of Cure Brand AND Trademark is dedicated to providing the highest quality for Teething Babies. Baltic amber necklaces are made for wearing (not chewing) when a baby is teething to reduce inflammation in the body. The warmth from the skin releases the active ingredient in the Baltic amber, succinic acid. Recent scientific research has proved that succinic acid has a very positive influence on the human body. It improves immunity and the balance of acids when absorbed into the bloodstream; it stimulates the thyroid glands to help reduce drooling when used for teething and soothes red inflamed cheeks. Amber's anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties are recognized by allopathic medicine as a natural analgesic, which will help to relieve teething pain and calm a baby without resorting to drugs. The skin's warmth releases healing oils from the amber, a resin, which is absorbed into the bloodstream. Parent supervision is recommended at all times. They are 12-12.5 in. Packaging is custom from The Art of Cure and comes with a Keepsake pouch. The Art of Cure Baltic Amber is guaranteed to be of the highest quality and made to the best standards.

  "Milkscreen: Home Test to Detect Alcohol in Breast Milk 8 Pack In just two minutes, milkscreen quickly and accurately analyzes breast milk for alcohol. Every mother is unique so, naturally, the way our bodies metabolize alcohol is unique, too. Metabolizing alcohol depends on several factors including body weight, type of alcohol consumed, and food intake so milkscreen was created to eliminate those variables. milkscreen also helps ensure that the alcohol concentrated in Moms breast milk is not at a level that may have negative impacts on Baby. Studies have shown infants consuming breast milk with alcohol concentrations at approximately 30mg/dl, or 0.03%, and higher have exhibited distinctive changes in feeding behavior and sleep. Babies consume less if the milk contains alcohol and they also sleep less and wake more frequently. We have set the milkscreen test to show a color change at 0.02% to help Mom stay within recommended feeding guidelines.",

Kair bath visor consists of a soft air filled sealing tube, a flexible brim and a springy headband embedded inside the lower portion of the brim. The air filled sealing tube acts like a semi-filled inner tire providing a comfortable air cushion between the wearer's head and the headband. Moreover it utilizes the air inside the sealing tube to distribute the gentle pressure evenly along the wearer's hairline to achieve a consistent sealing effect. The sealing tube is just semi-filled to allow a sensitive response to the pressure exerted by the springy headband. While some portions being compressed, other portions can be easily popped up to fill any gaps between the wearer's head and the headband. Therefore, leak proof is guaranteed. Kair bath visor also has an open-ended design, making it truly one size for all. Kair bath visor is also designed for easy to use in both shower and bath with your hands free. All the external parts of the visor are made of silicone rubber as used in many other baby products, so it is safe, durable and comfortable.

  "Thirsties Duo Hemp Prefold, White, Size One (6-18 lbs) Thirsties is revolutionizing the most widely used cloth diaper in the world. Prefold cloth diapers are popular for their affordability and are the most common diaper supplied by cloth diaper services. Though they don't share all the bells and whistles as other more modern cloth diapers, they have their definite and permanent place in the industry and they have been proven dependable and economical. However, Thirsties Duo Hemp Prefolds are no ordinary prefold. We've solved many of the cons of prefold diapers in our patent-pending design. Ordinary prefolds are bulky and take a long time to dry. When hung to dry, they can become stiff and crunchy. In addition, most prefolds are 8 layers thick in the middle, which makes it difficult to clean all layers of the diaper thoroughly. Thirsties Duo Hemp Prefolds are designed to allow air flow and each panel is only 2 layers thick which allows for thorough cleansing with little effort and quick drying times. Our custom hemp jersey is as soft as your favorite t-shirt and it knitted with love right here in the USA. In fact, our hemp jersey is 25% more absorbent than a prefold of the same weight made from cotton alone. This translates into a very trim and effective cloth diaper with a hefty amount of absorbing power. Made in USA",

The nipple's hourglass shape lets little lips close properly, allowing them to breathe easier through their noses. The extra wide base mimics the shape of mom's breast during breastfeeding and the special positioning of the flat area helps reposition the jaw.The convex topside of the nipple eases digestion while the ventilation hole helps prevent colic by reducing the amount of air your baby swallows.NUK Air System for Proper Air FlowThis NUK bottle features the NUK Air System technology, which mimics the shape and feel of the mother's breast during breastfeeding and encourages a natural development of the jaw. The NUK Air System valve regulates the intake of air and prevents the nipple from collapsing. This helps the baby swallow less air, which reduces the risk of colic and hiccups.Colorful Design to Delight BabyAs cute as it is innovative, this stylish bottle is decorated with brightly colored images that babies and parents will adore. Plus, the slightly curved shape makes it easy for little hands to grip.BPA-Free and Dishwasher SafeAll NUK products, including the Nature Orthodontic Bottle, are BPA-free, providing a safe way for your infant to feed.

  "Lipper International 516P High Chair, Pecan When a toddler first has the opportunity to eat a meal from the same surface as one's parents, the experience often imbues the young child with a great sense of achievement and importance. The significance is clear: the child has developed skills that he or she did not previously possess. Once the toddler achieves this dexterity, the baby high chair with its dinky tray no longer has a place at the dinner table. However, a toddler still requires a boost to reach the dinner plate, necessitating a tray-less high chair. Familiar from use in family restaurants around the world, this Lipper International wooden high chair offers toddlers a secure seat for tableside eating. Lipper designed the chair for children 1- to 3-1/2- years old, or up to 35 pounds in weight. Simple yet practical, the high chair aesthetically blends into many kitchen and dining room d&#xE9;cors with ease.The high chair prevents tipping with its durable and weighty beech wood construction and a sturdy 19-1/2-by-21-inch base. The seat stands 20 inches from the floor, while the armrest dowel hovers 7 inches over the seat. A 9-inch high seatback with a broad wooden slat keeps the child sitting upright. A 3-point safety strap system secures the child with a lap belt, which threads through the crouch restraint. To reduce splinter potential, a non-toxic pecan finish smoothes the wood surface. Subtly rounded corners also decrease the risk of injuries. Easy to clean, wipe the high chair down with a damp cloth. Use a mild soap on marks and dry immediately to prevent water damage. Upon delivery, the chair requires some assembly with tools. The Thailand-made chair also comes with cherry or natural finishes. The high chair measures 20 by 19-3/4 by 28-3/4 inches and weighs 16 pounds upon shipping.--Jessica Reuling",

This is why we love the idea of a baby swing; we've seen how they provide a comfortable, safe place for an infant, with soothing, rocking motions to help maintain a very important sense of security and calm. If you're familiar with older models of baby swings -- with their creaky mechanical noises and uncomfortable seats -- you should know that the Zen Collection swing definitely takes baby swings to another level.The swing's seat is designed for infants who cannot yet sit unassisted. Its basket shape provides security and support for the youngest babies, and it can be adjusted to sit the baby up or recline down. A plush seat cover, padded head support, and built-in cover keep baby comfortable. The swing seat can be positioned to move back and forth or from side to side, and it has a speed-control dial to allow for a variety of graduated speed settings. The swing is powered by battery or can be plugged in with the included adapter. It moves in a smooth, quiet motion with minimal mechanical noise. While baby is swinging, he can listen to one of 14 different soothing sounds with adjustable volume, including Muzak-esque remixes of classical favorites and unobtrusive nature sounds, like chirping birds and babbling brooks.Knowing parents will especially appreciate that the baby seat is removable and portable. So once baby falls asleep in the swing, you don't have to disturb him by removing him from the seat. Just lift the seat out of the swing to carry him with you to different rooms in your home.It's So Lovely!A baby swing is not small -- it's basically a piece of furniture. So we're delighted to find that the Zen Collection swing offers a contemporary and sophisticated palette that can complement your home's d&eacute;cor without making your house look like one big nursery. You won't find any frills or pastel colors here. Its contemporary pattern features sprays of leaves and dragonfly silhouettes in stylish tones of cream, chocolate brown, and moss green with ruby-red accents.Its lovely textural touches include wood-finished handles, satin accents, and embroidered detailing on the cover, as well as on the mobile toys, which are cute and stylish. The toys include two plush dragonflies and a plush turtle, topped with matching umbrellas. It stands on a sturdy, dark brown, metal frame that's heavy enough to provide good support and security. Not only is this swing good looking, it also makes a great choice for unisex decorating.Easy Assembly, Sturdy ConstructionThe swing took us less than half an hour to assemble and required only a Phillips screwdriver. One minor problem: we had to re-thread the mobile so it could hang properly. The assembled swing has a 26-by-33-inch footprint and stands 47 inches tall with the mobile attached, so it takes up quite a bit of room. This is something to consider if you have limited living space. However, the base folds together easily, so you can lean it against a wall when it's not in use.What's in the BoxRemovable infant seat, mobile, swing motor, swing frame components for assembly.",

A built-in three-layer microfiber terry soaker absorbs an amazing seven times its weight in liquid. The soaker is topped with our stay-dry microfleece which keeps your baby feeling dry. All in all, Thirsties Duo AIO gets a BIG thumbs-up from your wallet, your family, your daycare facility, and your occasional caretakers alike.  Both hook & loop and snap closures are available on Thirsties Duo line. While many families prefer hook & loop closures because of the simple, secure fit they provide, snap closures do have a few advantages of their own. They are pretty much indestructible and are more unyielding than our hook & loop closures, making them more challenging to unfasten for a toddler who prefers to go naked. The mission of Thirsties, Inc. is to make it easy and affordable for every family to choose cloth while simultaneously investing in our local economy and sustainable business practices. We are very proud of the fact that all Thirsties products are manufactured in Colorado, USA, by a group of very talented individuals, many of whom are moms who work in the comfort and convenience of their own homes. We delight in the opportunity to sell products that contribute to a happy and healthy start for your children while helping to minimize your baby&#x2019;s first carbon footprints.

  "RLR Laundry Treatment and Cloth Diaper Stripper RLR Laundry Treatment is one of the best and easiest product used to strip your cloth diapers. It gets the extra detergent and build up OUT of your cloth diapers!! It's not a soap or detergent, it's a laundry treatment. During a regular wash, mineral deposits, soil sediment and residual matter from detergent can all accumulate in your fabrics causing it to look dingy. Using RLR removes that build-up, leaving whites whiter and colors brighter without using bleach or bluing agents. RLR Laundry Treatment works by removing these particles from the clothing, holding them in suspension in the water and preventing them from redepositing so they rinse away &amp; leave fabric looking like new. We recommend using RLR Laundry Treatment as a preventative every 30-60 days or when a problem with leaks or smelly diapers occur. Directions for stripping your cloth diapers: Fill washer to highest setting with warm water, add 1 packet of RLR for top loaders or 1/2 packet for front loaders. Next add up to 60 diaper items (30 inserts, 30 diapers or 20 diapers 40 inserts etc.) Soak for 30 minutes and then run a normal wash cycle. Rinse &amp; spin twice, hang dry diaper shells &amp; dry your inserts in the dryer. RLR Laundry Treatment contains no dyes, perfumes or phosphates, is completely bio-degradable and non-polluting.",

The Art of Cure Brand AND Trademark is dedicated to providing the highest quality for Teething Babies. Baltic amber necklaces are made for wearing (not chewing) when a baby is teething to reduce inflammation in the body. The warmth from the skin releases the active ingredient in the Baltic amber, succinic acid. Recent scientific research has proved that succinic acid has a very positive influence on the human body. It improves immunity and the balance of acids when absorbed into the bloodstream; it stimulates the thyroid glands to help reduce drooling when used for teething and soothes red inflamed cheeks. Amber's anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties are recognized by allopathic medicine as a natural analgesic, which will help to relieve teething pain and calm a baby without resorting to drugs. The skin's warmth releases healing oils from the amber, a resin, which is absorbed into the bloodstream. Parent supervision is recommended at all times. They are 12-12.5 in. Packaging is custom from The Art of Cure and comes with a Keepsake pouch. The Art of Cure Baltic Amber is guaranteed to be of the highest quality and made to the best standards.

  "Inclined to Sleep If only they made these for grownups. Inclined to Sleep&#x92;s memory foam structure is firm but forgiving, because it supports the infant frame from head to toe, while allowing babies (up to 6 months) to snooze without awkward positioning or accidents. The sleeper is structured to form a 60-degree angle which, like the memory foam it's made of, takes pressure off the spine, sides, and pressure points. Velcro attachments on the machine-washable covering also allows for a custom fit, based on the size--and preferences--of your baby. One note about older babies, however: because they could flip themselves over or turn in awkward positions, the unit could be a possible suffocation threat. Be sure your child is young and small enough for it.--Diane Beall",

Dr. William Sears, noted pediatrician and  author (with his wife Martha, a registered nurse) of child-care books,  includingThe Baby BookandParenting the Fussy Baby,  recommends it highly. His research reveals that parents who \"wear\" their  babies experience a deep bonding with them; babies cry less when comforted  by the close movement, touch, smell, and sound of a loved one; and such  babies spend more time in a state of \"quiet alertness,\" which is the optimal  state for learning. Designed by Dr. Sears to foster the physical and emotional  closeness of \"attachment parenting,\" the Babysling Cradle lets you carry your  baby (up to 20 pounds) in comfort and safety. The fabric sling with its  extra-padded elastic railing nestles baby in a natural position. Your  warmth and touch do the rest.

  "Milkscreen: Home Test to Detect Alcohol in Breast Milk 8 Pack In just two minutes, milkscreen quickly and accurately analyzes breast milk for alcohol. Every mother is unique so, naturally, the way our bodies metabolize alcohol is unique, too. Metabolizing alcohol depends on several factors including body weight, type of alcohol consumed, and food intake so milkscreen was created to eliminate those variables. milkscreen also helps ensure that the alcohol concentrated in Moms breast milk is not at a level that may have negative impacts on Baby. Studies have shown infants consuming breast milk with alcohol concentrations at approximately 30mg/dl, or 0.03%, and higher have exhibited distinctive changes in feeding behavior and sleep. Babies consume less if the milk contains alcohol and they also sleep less and wake more frequently. We have set the milkscreen test to show a color change at 0.02% to help Mom stay within recommended feeding guidelines.",

  "DEX Products Sound Sleeper SS-01 For parents whose vocal cords can&rsquo;t hold out for 200 rounds of \"Hush Little Baby,\" a sound machine is a must for baby bedtime routines. And the DEX Sound Sleeper is one of the best ones we&rsquo;ve ever found. This small (6 by 10 by 12 inches), simple device features a high quality speaker, on/off or 60-minute timer switch, volume control, single, combine, or random mode, power adapter capability, headphone jack (headphones not included), and, most spectacularly, 10 sound options which can be combined to make 24 sound combinations altogether.Doctors and sleep experts recommend a consistent, relaxing sleep routine for newborns and older babies. Freeing baby&rsquo;s sleep environment of jarring or distracting outside noises is an important step in creating a soothing space for sleep. The Sound Sleeper provides just enough peaceful background noise to block household hubbub. Once baby becomes familiar with the sounds of this machine, she&rsquo;ll probably start yawning the minute she hears it!The Sounds of (Near) SilenceThe sounds of Sound Sleeper don&rsquo;t have to be boring, just relaxing and repetitive. Experiment with the various sounds to find the perfect soporific.Summer NightThe buzz of peeper frogs and insects is a happy, sleepy, country sound.RainWhat&rsquo;s cozier than curling up in bed with a gentle rainstorm pattering outside the window?BrookBurble, burble, burble&mdash;just don&rsquo;t try this one when your toddler is potty-training!OceanThe deep tranquility of a calm ocean is unmatched for its lulling ability.WindThe wind blows quietly in the trees, but you and baby are safe and sound at home.WombThe rhythmic swishing sounds of the womb: it&rsquo;s a natural for soothing baby!SeagullJust a few lonely seagull cries, widely spaced.BirdPretty, delicate bird song.BuoyThe distant ringing of a bell buoy. Great in combination with the Ocean sound.ThunderThunder rumbles, but the storm always stays far off in the distance. Best combined with Rain, of course.Experiment with the Combine mode to find the perfect sleep-inducing sounds for your baby. We like Brook and Bird, Wind and Thunder, and Ocean and Buoy, but who knows? Maybe the magic combination will be Womb and Seagull!The power adapter feature of the Sound Sleeper is very handy for everyday use. The ability to leave the sound machine on all night long (or put it on the one-hour timer) is invaluable. Babies are notorious for waking up throughout the night; when they hear the same soothing sounds they fell asleep to, it will be much easier to return to those sweet dreams.--Emilie Coulter",

It obtains the body temperature reading with 0.3 degree accuracy in less than 1 second through a click. The IR thermometer features an intuitive guidance system to secure positioning and confirm accurate readings. Temperatures (Fahrenheit or Celsius) are displayed on a huge back-lit LCD screen for easier reading even in total darkness. Adjustable audio alarm will alert you if the temperature is too high.

  "green sprouts Organic Terry Circus Animal Teether-Cornflower Tiger For over two decades i play., Inc. has been researching children's health issues to make safer feeding accessories that come in contact with babies' mouths and foods. Due to recent safety issues in children's toys we saw a need for toys free from potentially harmful toxins. So in 2008 we launched a new line of PVC, phthalate, BPA and nitrosamine free toys made from synthetic materials. Inside Baby: Pregnancy and early childhood are critical times in babies' lives because they are growing and developing so rapidly. During this time they are vulnerable to elements in their environment, and parents should protect them as much as possible from exposure to potentially harmful substances. The first priority for growing babies is to make sure everything babies put inside their mouth is healthy, safe and promotes the development of strong immune system.  &#x2022; PVC free and Phthalate free: PolyVinyl Chloride (PVC) is a hard plastic that requires harsh chemical softeners, such as phthalates, to make it appropriate for use in soft plastic baby toys such as squirty toys. In 2003 we discovered that phthalates were shown to disrupt reproductive functions and cause other developmental problems, so we launched a line of toys free from PVC and phthalates.  &#x2022; BPA free: Bisphenol-A (BPA) is used in hard, clear plastics sometimes used in baby toys to prevent breakage. In 2006 we learned that BPA also disrupts reproductive functions and causes other developmental problems, so we added a line of BPA free toys to our line. &#x2022; Nitrosamine free: Nitrosamines are found in latex products such as some infant teethers. They have been shown to cause cancer in many animals, so all our teethers and soothers are nitrosamine free.",

  "Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Newborn Feeding Set Colic. The word strikes fear in the heart of any parent. This mysterious ailment seems to have its roots in the belly of the baby, although no one has determined for sure what causes these uncontrollable bouts of crying in newborns. However, it is certain that a baby with gas is an unhappy baby, and anything that alleviates that pain can only be a good thing. Enter Dr. Brown&#x92;s Natural Flow Newborn Feeding Set. For parents who bottle-feed, for whatever reason, these specialized bottles may make the difference between a howling, gassy baby and one who is content and well-fed. What&#x92;s the secret?Internal Vent Decreases Vacuum EffectA patented system enables babies to feed more comfortably because the built-in vent discourages ingestion of air bubbles. It also prevents the development of a vacuum, which helps reduce fluid in the ear. Ensuring that the milk in the bottle flows out through the nipple while the air is channeled through a tube to the other end also eliminates another unique problem of bottle-feeding: nipple collapse. The positive-pressure design mimics breastfeeding and can be used with breast milk or formula.In Plain English, PleaseThe bottle prevents air bubbles from getting into baby&#x92;s tummy.No Air Bubbles, No GasAnd no gas, no colic&#x85;at least that&#x92;s the principle. At a minimum, baby will be more comfortable while his digestive system develops.A Note to ParentsThe first time parents use the Natural Flow system, they will need to be very conscientious about readingand followingthe detailed instructions. No shortcuts, please! Washing the bottle parts carefully is always important, and resisting the urge to become cavalier about mixing formula, heating milk, or checking for tears or cracks is important to your baby&#x92;s health and safety. Time spent attending to these details is well spent.What&#x92;s in the Box?Dr. Brown&#x92;s newborn feeding set includes everything needed to get started on the wonderful, ever-changing world of sustaining an infant (except the actual milk, that is): Three 8-ounce standard baby bottles, two 4-ounce standard baby bottles, five Level-One silicone nipples, two extra Level-Two silicone nipples (faster-flowing for the older baby), five 2-piece patented internal vents, two storage/travel caps, three cleaning brushes, and instructions.--Emilie Coulter",

After positioning the tightener next to the car seat and fitting your vehicle's seat belt through the included spindle slot, simply ratchet the tightener's handle until the seat belt is snug around the base of the car seat. Removing the belt tightener is also very fast and easy.--Chris Burns",

The chief advantage of the  Cooshie is its semisoft foam construction: firm enough for support,  but both lightweight and comfortable. It's also short in the back (3  inches of seat padding plus 3 inches of back makes it 6 inches high);  this is something of a compromise between portability and back support.  Overall dimensions are 13 inches deep by 6 inches high by 14 inches  wide; that's a little bulky to drag around to restaurants, perhaps, but  ideal for making use of big-people chairs at home. Another advantage  over the hard-plastic booster: the stippled foam won't slide around on  a wooden chair. A not-very-durable tote bag is included.--Richard  Farr",

  "Medela Pump in Style Advanced Double Breast Pump The most important difference between the Medela Pump in Style Advanced model and the Original is that the Advanced pump includes a pretty remarkable feature that actually mimics a baby&#x92;s nursing rhythm by pumping in two distinct modes: let-down and expression. In the first few moments of nursing, babies initiate faster milk flow by suckling rapidly. After the flow is established, baby switches to slower, deeper suckling for maximum milk flow in less time. The \"Natural Expression\" system simulates this two-stage pattern for a highly efficient, effective pumping experience. In other ways the pump is similar to the also first-rate Original: a stylish and professional looking black shoulder bag houses the pump with adjustable speed and vacuum control, along with battery pack, AC adapter, four bottles with lids, bottle stands, \"PersonalFit\" breastshields, removable cooler carrier with ice packs, bottle holder, extra storage pockets, and a built-in picture frame for a photo of your pride and joy.

To use this feature, simply pull out the other half of the attached soaker pad and lay it over the body of the diaper. If you prefer all natural fabrics touching your baby's skin, simply keep the unattached portion of the soaker pad tucked inside the pocket.",

  "Philips Avent iQ24 Sterilizer with 2 Bottles, 9 oz Baby care requires so much time and vigilant attention. Any appliance that takes the guesswork (and a few precious minutes) out of the endless feeding routine is a blessing to caregivers. The Avent IQ24 Sterilizer is a relatively small, simple appliance that sterilizes up to six (Avent brand) bottles and/or screw rings, nipples, pacifiers, and breast pump components in just six minutes. The contents then stay sterile for six hours, providing the lid is not removed. An optional second mode keeps bottle- and breastfeeding accessories sterile for up to 24 hours by continuously repeating the cycle, so baby can have clean, sterile bottles day and night. And as we know, babies actively require feeding 24/7, so this is no idle bonus!A Sterilizer with an IQThe Avent iQ24 Electronic Steam Sterilizer is so named because the makers consider it an \"intelligent\" product, using \"advanced iQ technology.\" And it really is pretty smart. The machine communicates each phase of the sterilization cycle, so you never have to guess whether the bottles or breast pump accessories are actually sterile yet. A digital display, electronic countdown, and sound alerts give parents the assurance that baby will not be contaminated with the bacteria that lurk in unclean feeding equipment. Another cool feature is the ability to \"pause\" the cycle (again, read the instructions to do this properly!) in order to remove some items without interrupting the cycle.Putting the Sterilizer TogetherAlthough the iQ24 Sterilizer is relatively easy to assemble and use, it&#x92;s not necessarily intuitive. In other words, you&#x92;re probably going to have to read the instruction manual pretty carefully the first time around. After that, it should be a piece of cake. Basically, there is a pot with power cord, a lower basket, a bottle rack, an upper basket (plus a spare upper basket), a lid, measuring cup, and tongs. Two 9-ounce bottles are included, as well, along with nipples, screw rings, and dome caps. The baskets and bottle rack slide onto a central stem, and the bottles and breast pump components are placed in the appropriate baskets or rack. The sterilizer cleverly uses bottle screw rings to separate the baskets and bottle rack, putting the very items to be sterilized to good secondary use! Once the correct amount of water is added and all parts are assembled and loaded (and that&#x92;s the hardest part, figuring out which basket and bottle parts go where), simply plug the sterilizer body into an electrical outlet, select mode one or two (for six-hour or 24-hour sterilization cycles), and wait six minutes (for either mode). You&#x92;ll also need to study the information pamphlet for a translation of the various beeps and flashing lights on the display, but generally it will be obvious when the sterilization cycle has begun and ended, and what to do next (feed that baby!).Dishwasher BasketAs a bonus feature, two baskets can be clipped together to hold small items such as nipples, breast pump parts, pacifiers, etc., for washing in the top rack of your dishwasher prior to sterilization. Keep in mind that Avent items may discolor over time if they are washed in the dishwasher with dirty dishes covered with remnants of strong sauces, such as tomato or curry sauce.Note: Sterilization is not the same as, nor should it replace, washing! All bottles and breast pump supplies should be washed carefully in mild, soapy water, and rinsed, before sterilizing. Also, for optimal effectiveness of the sterilizer, and to reduce limescale build-up, use distilled water for sterilizing. Regardless of whether you use tap or distilled water, you should de-scale the sterilizer every four weeks or so (read manual for instructions).--Emilie Coulter",

  "BABYBJORN Baby Sitter 1-2-3 Activity Bouncer, Black Gingham Rock-a-bye Baby Bjorn&#x85;From the first name in front carriers for babies comes a handsome bouncy seat that any parent would be proud to position in the living room among the leather sofas and sleek coffee tables. But don&#x92;t be fooled. This seat is far, far more than a fashion accessory for image-conscious parents.The bouncy seat is one of the most important and useful pieces of baby gear most families will have in their homes. It would be lovely if we could all sit around with our babes in arms all day, every day; alas, dishes, laundry, dinner, and older children call. Bouncy seats allow the youngest members of the family to enjoy the chaos swirling around them from the comfort and peace of their own personal recliner. And in a pleasantly pared-down departure from the jingly-jangly, swishy-splashy seats that confront parents shopping for a basic bouncy seat, the only bell or whistle on the Baby Sitter 1-2-3 is a toy bar with three solid wood teddy bear shapes. No cutesy faces, no fancy textures or fabrics, no I.Q.-enhancing games and sound effects. No batteries.This bouncy seat simply, well, bounces. The slightest movement causes a relaxing bounce--no on/off buttons or six degrees of vibration, just baby&#x92;s natural wiggling. Depending on your tot&#x92;s mood and wakefulness, the seat can be adjusted to three different positions for sleeping, resting, and playing. The deep recline is terrific for daytime snoozes, while the most upright position will be especially handy when baby gets a little older and is ready for more interaction with the world.The seat can be adjusted to three different positions for sleeping, resting, and playing.The attractive black fabric of the seat cover is reversible, from flat black to flat black with a diagonal pattern of a million faint gray \"Baby Bjorn\"s. Either way, the look is subtle, sophisticated, and unforgiving of yogurt or rice cereal stains&#x85;Luckily, it&#x92;s easily machine washable (drip dry). Come to think of it, in this day and age, any piece of baby gear that is not machine washable needs to go straight to the museum of ancient artifacts, for crying out loud. The restraint system buttons (yes, buttons!) securely at three points, and is removable to wash, reverse patterns, or keep off entirely once baby is able to walk or to climb in and out of the seat herself.That&#x92;s right, you read that correctly! No need to scold your toddler for trying to get into baby&#x92;s seat; this bouncy seat is suitable for 8-pound newborns as well as kids up to 24 months (or a maximum of 29 pounds). Just be sure to remove and stow that restraint system. Another good safety feature is the non-skid base, as well as the reminder never to place the inhabited seat on a table or other elevated surfaces.Unlike the two- or three-month life spans of so many toys and equipment for children, this is one baby item that will truly grow with your little angel, up to two years! Even if it costs a bit more than some, make sure you&#x92;re measuring that price against the number of months of use; most bouncy seats are workable up until around seven months or so, in spite of the actual age/weight range listed. This will serve as a cool seat for an eighteen-month-old, as well as a cozy bouncy for an infant.Collapsible to a width of about four inches, the Baby Sitter 1-2-3 will easily accompany families to Grandma&#x92;s house, restaurants, tropical resorts&#x85; The Baby Bjorn Baby Sitter 1-2-3 is the proud and deserving recipient of the Practical Parenting Best Buy award as well as best in test in Swedish parenting magazine. Elegantly simple, the minimalist design is so appealing for parents already weary of the jarringly bright colors and tinny sounds of so many bouncy seats (and other baby paraphernalia). Plus it&#x92;s great for photo ops &#x96; no distracting background!--Emilie Coulter",

BALTIC AMBER TEETHING JEWELRY? The Art of Cure Brand AND Trademark is dedicated to providing the highest quality for Teething Babies. Baltic amber Jewelry is made for wearing (not chewing) when a baby is teething to reduce inflammation in the body. The warmth from the skin releases the active ingredient in the Baltic amber, succinic acid. Recent scientific research has proved that succinic acid has a very positive influence on the human body. It improves immunity and the balance of acids when absorbed into the bloodstream; it stimulates the thyroid glands to help reduce drooling when used for teething and soothes red inflamed cheeks. Amber's anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties are recognized by allopathic medicine as a natural analgesic, which will help to relieve teething pain and calm a baby without resorting to drugs. The skin's warmth releases healing oils from the amber, a resin, which is absorbed into the bloodstream. Parent supervision is recommended at all times. They are 12-12.5 in. Packaging is custom from The Art of Cure and comes with a Keepsake pouch. The Art of Cure Baltic Amber is guaranteed to be of the highest quality and made to the best standards.

  "Today's Mom Cozy Cuddler Pregnancy Pillow - White A good maternity pillow needs to have a combination of comfort and convenience for the mother. It's all about mom's comfort and whatever it takes to keep her comfortable. The Today's Mom Cozy Cuddler is an excellent maternity pillow. Today's Mom has listened to the biggest concerns about versions of pregnancy body pillow and made the adjustments mommy was looking for.The Cozy Cuddler has a unique design which follows the natural shape of mommy's body from head to toe. One of the big upgrades on the pregnancy pillow is the shoulder comfort system, unique to Today's Mom. One of the biggest complaints was hard edges which dug into the shoulder while mommy slept and left mommy feeling discomfort. The Cozy Cuddler is a pregnancy pillow which has a curved shaped shoulder support design which contours to the shoulder and provides comfort instead of pain. Another huge feature on this pregnancy body pillow is the lumbar support. It correctly supports mommy's weight while she sleeps. The belly support is another important upgrade mothers demanded. This maternity pillow features a belly support which allows the belly to rest on the support and keep baby comfortable. But, perhaps the biggest feature is the large, square resting area. Other versions of maternity body pillow feature a flimsy, oddly shaped area for the head.

  "Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Newborn Feeding Set Colic. The word strikes fear in the heart of any parent. This mysterious ailment seems to have its roots in the belly of the baby, although no one has determined for sure what causes these uncontrollable bouts of crying in newborns. However, it is certain that a baby with gas is an unhappy baby, and anything that alleviates that pain can only be a good thing. Enter Dr. Brown&#x92;s Natural Flow Newborn Feeding Set. For parents who bottle-feed, for whatever reason, these specialized bottles may make the difference between a howling, gassy baby and one who is content and well-fed. What&#x92;s the secret?Internal Vent Decreases Vacuum EffectA patented system enables babies to feed more comfortably because the built-in vent discourages ingestion of air bubbles. It also prevents the development of a vacuum, which helps reduce fluid in the ear. Ensuring that the milk in the bottle flows out through the nipple while the air is channeled through a tube to the other end also eliminates another unique problem of bottle-feeding: nipple collapse. The positive-pressure design mimics breastfeeding and can be used with breast milk or formula.In Plain English, PleaseThe bottle prevents air bubbles from getting into baby&#x92;s tummy.No Air Bubbles, No GasAnd no gas, no colic&#x85;at least that&#x92;s the principle. At a minimum, baby will be more comfortable while his digestive system develops.A Note to ParentsThe first time parents use the Natural Flow system, they will need to be very conscientious about readingand followingthe detailed instructions. No shortcuts, please! Washing the bottle parts carefully is always important, and resisting the urge to become cavalier about mixing formula, heating milk, or checking for tears or cracks is important to your baby&#x92;s health and safety. Time spent attending to these details is well spent.What&#x92;s in the Box?Dr. Brown&#x92;s newborn feeding set includes everything needed to get started on the wonderful, ever-changing world of sustaining an infant (except the actual milk, that is): Three 8-ounce standard baby bottles, two 4-ounce standard baby bottles, five Level-One silicone nipples, two extra Level-Two silicone nipples (faster-flowing for the older baby), five 2-piece patented internal vents, two storage/travel caps, three cleaning brushes, and instructions.--Emilie Coulter",

  "Philips Avent iQ24 Sterilizer with 2 Bottles, 9 oz Baby care requires so much time and vigilant attention. Any appliance that takes the guesswork (and a few precious minutes) out of the endless feeding routine is a blessing to caregivers. The Avent IQ24 Sterilizer is a relatively small, simple appliance that sterilizes up to six (Avent brand) bottles and/or screw rings, nipples, pacifiers, and breast pump components in just six minutes. The contents then stay sterile for six hours, providing the lid is not removed. An optional second mode keeps bottle- and breastfeeding accessories sterile for up to 24 hours by continuously repeating the cycle, so baby can have clean, sterile bottles day and night. And as we know, babies actively require feeding 24/7, so this is no idle bonus!A Sterilizer with an IQThe Avent iQ24 Electronic Steam Sterilizer is so named because the makers consider it an \"intelligent\" product, using \"advanced iQ technology.\" And it really is pretty smart. The machine communicates each phase of the sterilization cycle, so you never have to guess whether the bottles or breast pump accessories are actually sterile yet. A digital display, electronic countdown, and sound alerts give parents the assurance that baby will not be contaminated with the bacteria that lurk in unclean feeding equipment. Another cool feature is the ability to \"pause\" the cycle (again, read the instructions to do this properly!) in order to remove some items without interrupting the cycle.Putting the Sterilizer TogetherAlthough the iQ24 Sterilizer is relatively easy to assemble and use, it&#x92;s not necessarily intuitive. In other words, you&#x92;re probably going to have to read the instruction manual pretty carefully the first time around. After that, it should be a piece of cake. Basically, there is a pot with power cord, a lower basket, a bottle rack, an upper basket (plus a spare upper basket), a lid, measuring cup, and tongs. Two 9-ounce bottles are included, as well, along with nipples, screw rings, and dome caps. The baskets and bottle rack slide onto a central stem, and the bottles and breast pump components are placed in the appropriate baskets or rack. The sterilizer cleverly uses bottle screw rings to separate the baskets and bottle rack, putting the very items to be sterilized to good secondary use! Once the correct amount of water is added and all parts are assembled and loaded (and that&#x92;s the hardest part, figuring out which basket and bottle parts go where), simply plug the sterilizer body into an electrical outlet, select mode one or two (for six-hour or 24-hour sterilization cycles), and wait six minutes (for either mode). You&#x92;ll also need to study the information pamphlet for a translation of the various beeps and flashing lights on the display, but generally it will be obvious when the sterilization cycle has begun and ended, and what to do next (feed that baby!).Dishwasher BasketAs a bonus feature, two baskets can be clipped together to hold small items such as nipples, breast pump parts, pacifiers, etc., for washing in the top rack of your dishwasher prior to sterilization. Keep in mind that Avent items may discolor over time if they are washed in the dishwasher with dirty dishes covered with remnants of strong sauces, such as tomato or curry sauce.Note: Sterilization is not the same as, nor should it replace, washing! All bottles and breast pump supplies should be washed carefully in mild, soapy water, and rinsed, before sterilizing. Also, for optimal effectiveness of the sterilizer, and to reduce limescale build-up, use distilled water for sterilizing. Regardless of whether you use tap or distilled water, you should de-scale the sterilizer every four weeks or so (read manual for instructions).--Emilie Coulter",

  "Joovy Tricycoo Tricycle, Greenie The Joovy Tricycoo is a tricycle for children as young as 18 months. The Tricycoo is the perfect way to introduce your child to balance and coordination, one step at a time. Your child will love the adventure of piloting their very first vehicle and parents love that they are in control while their child masters each stage of learning. The concept of the Tricycoo is simple - your child does not need to steer, pedal or balance on their own.  They simply enjoy the fun and independence of their first tricycle while you guide them with the parent push handle (removable).  When engaged, the parent push handle overrides the steering on the Tricycoo. It has 4-positions and is adjustable from 32.5\" to 38\" high. While your child is getting used to the idea of balancing and holding on to the handlebars, the front wheel pedals can be unlocked; this allows the pedals to spin freely without force and \"go\" without the need to pedal. The removable 'baby surround arms' safely enclose your child on the seat and the fold down footrest gives more stability to the child when riding. This gives them confidence and support while they perfect their balancing. The Joovy Tricycoo is first class all the way - unlike most tricycles with blow-molded wheels, the Tricycoo sports injection-molded wheels with urethane treads. Parents love these wheels because they roll quietly on most floors. For additional fun, the Tricycoo is equipped with a bell on the handlebar and a large rear basket for take-along play. The Tricycoo frame is constructed of steel and it supports a child up to 44 pounds. When your child masters the first phase on the Tricycoo, you'll be ready to remove the parent push handle, 'baby surround arms' and fold up the footrest. The front wheel pedals can be locked to allow the child to pedal using their own power. Now you can smile and watch as your child pilots their Tricycoo all by themselves. Assembly is required.",

This is why we love the idea of a baby swing; we've seen how they provide a comfortable, safe place for an infant, with soothing, rocking motions to help maintain a very important sense of security and calm. If you're familiar with older models of baby swings -- with their creaky mechanical noises and uncomfortable seats -- you should know that the Zen Collection swing definitely takes baby swings to another level.The swing's seat is designed for infants who cannot yet sit unassisted. Its basket shape provides security and support for the youngest babies, and it can be adjusted to sit the baby up or recline down. A plush seat cover, padded head support, and built-in cover keep baby comfortable. The swing seat can be positioned to move back and forth or from side to side, and it has a speed-control dial to allow for a variety of graduated speed settings. The swing is powered by battery or can be plugged in with the included adapter. It moves in a smooth, quiet motion with minimal mechanical noise. While baby is swinging, he can listen to one of 14 different soothing sounds with adjustable volume, including Muzak-esque remixes of classical favorites and unobtrusive nature sounds, like chirping birds and babbling brooks.Knowing parents will especially appreciate that the baby seat is removable and portable. So once baby falls asleep in the swing, you don't have to disturb him by removing him from the seat. Just lift the seat out of the swing to carry him with you to different rooms in your home.It's So Lovely!A baby swing is not small -- it's basically a piece of furniture. So we're delighted to find that the Zen Collection swing offers a contemporary and sophisticated palette that can complement your home's d&eacute;cor without making your house look like one big nursery. You won't find any frills or pastel colors here. Its contemporary pattern features sprays of leaves and dragonfly silhouettes in stylish tones of cream, chocolate brown, and moss green with ruby-red accents.Its lovely textural touches include wood-finished handles, satin accents, and embroidered detailing on the cover, as well as on the mobile toys, which are cute and stylish. The toys include two plush dragonflies and a plush turtle, topped with matching umbrellas. It stands on a sturdy, dark brown, metal frame that's heavy enough to provide good support and security. Not only is this swing good looking, it also makes a great choice for unisex decorating.Easy Assembly, Sturdy ConstructionThe swing took us less than half an hour to assemble and required only a Phillips screwdriver. One minor problem: we had to re-thread the mobile so it could hang properly. The assembled swing has a 26-by-33-inch footprint and stands 47 inches tall with the mobile attached, so it takes up quite a bit of room. This is something to consider if you have limited living space. However, the base folds together easily, so you can lean it against a wall when it's not in use.What's in the BoxRemovable infant seat, mobile, swing motor, swing frame components for assembly.",

  "Traveling Toddler Car Seat Travel Accessory ATTN: Britax owners. If our product is too short, please check to be sure your LATCH straps are in the forward facing position. Whether flying on an airplane or traveling by train or bus, it is safest and most comfortable for your child to be in a car seat. But traveling with a young child, their seat, and your carry-on can be tricky. Not anymore. The Traveling Toddler strap allows you to attach your LATCH and top tether equipped toddler's car seat to a rolling carry-on suitcase. Simply attach the LATCH and top tether straps from the car seat to the Traveling Toddler and adjust the straps so that the car seat is held securely on the suitcase. Once adjusted, the car seat can be detached and reattached to the suitcase in seconds. Lift the handle of your carry-on bag and you have a fun new stroller. Now there's an easy and inexpensive way to take your toddler's car seat and other gear on your trip. You do not have to buy a special seat or suitcase. As long as your suitcase handle locks in place, you can push it like a stroller. Your hands are free for check in and its simple to unhook for security. Keep your child safe and comfortable in their own seat. The Traveling Toddler has been tested with most major car seat brands including Graco, Eddie Bauer, Cosco, Evenflo, and Britax, and a variety of carry-on suitcases and has worked with every combination. It is important that the telescoping handle of your suitcase locks in place. If not, it might not stay extended when you try to push your child in front of you, though you would still be able to pull them. If flying, make sure that your car seat is FAA approved before traveling. The Traveling Toddler strap is made from heavyweight polypropylene webbing that will withstand 900 lbs of force. When not in use it easily slips in the pocket of your carry-on. As with any other wheeled child carrier, do not use the Traveling Toddler on stairs or escalators. Car seat and suitcase sold separately. Patent pending.",

  "Baby Bjorn Baby Carrier - Navy A little more expensive than most other baby carriers, this  Baby Bj&ouml;rn Carrier offers parents some wonderful design features that  make it worth the extra money. By allowing you to hold your baby snugly  against your chest, the carrier promotes a sense of comfort and  closeness between a parent and a child. It also allows you to maintain  eye contact with and talk to your little one during trips to the store,  walks around the house, and short hikes. The carrier's other big  advantage is that it frees up both your hands while you carry your  baby. The navy blue carrier consists of a large triangular front piece  that supports baby's head and body, along with a set of thick padded  straps that are worn like a shoulder-and-waist harness. Newborns and  smaller babies should always ride rear-facing in the carrier, while  older babies who can hold their heads upright unassisted can ride  forward-facing and enjoy the view ahead of them. Made of machine-washable, 100 percent cotton, the carrier can be easily adjusted from  the front for your baby's size. Although the carrier has been tested  for use with babies who weigh from 8 to 25 pounds, some parents found  that the carrier became uncomfortable to wear and placed a lot of  strain on the lower back when it was used to carry a child weighing  more than 20 pounds.--Chris Burns",

This makes cleaning and disinfecting a snap.Easily attach the Baby Comfort Ultra Plush changing pad cover.The three-inch beveled sides keep baby in a comfortable and compliant position while changing a diaper.

  "Inclined to Sleep If only they made these for grownups. Inclined to Sleep&#x92;s memory foam structure is firm but forgiving, because it supports the infant frame from head to toe, while allowing babies (up to 6 months) to snooze without awkward positioning or accidents. The sleeper is structured to form a 60-degree angle which, like the memory foam it's made of, takes pressure off the spine, sides, and pressure points. Velcro attachments on the machine-washable covering also allows for a custom fit, based on the size--and preferences--of your baby. One note about older babies, however: because they could flip themselves over or turn in awkward positions, the unit could be a possible suffocation threat. Be sure your child is young and small enough for it.--Diane Beall",

The Avent Express II Microwave Sterilizer is a modern-day technological wonder&hellip;and a joy for most parents, who will do anything for a little peace of mind and a few extra minutes to spare. Using a regular kitchen microwave, this lightweight sterilizer eliminates household bacteria and keeps contents sterile for up to 24 hours. It can be used to sterilize Avent feeding bottles of varying sizes (and their nipples, rings, and dome caps), Avent Isis breast pump accessories, Via cups and lids, Via Disposable Nursers, and other non-electrical Avent products. Its compact size and ease of use make the sterilizer perfect for traveling, too.Protect Your Baby from BacteriaThe Avent Express II Microwave Sterilizer effectively and quickly kills the kind of household bacteria that can wreak havoc on babies&rsquo; delicate new systems. Establishing a routine of washing bottles and pump supplies in gentle, soapy water, then sterilizing them, will ensure that baby will have a clean start in life.No More Pots and Pans and Boiling WaterThe Avent Express is simplicity itself once you get the hang of it. After reading the detailed instructions with great care (assembly and loading are not completely intuitive, and there are important details that can make all the difference in safety and effectiveness of the sterilizer), pour the correct amount of water into the base. Load the pre-washed bottles and feeding components into the appropriate spots in the plastic rack, position the lid over the sterilizer base and lock the clips into place. (You&rsquo;ll hear a click.) Place the sterilizer in the center of the microwave, and select microwave wattage and timings (a chart is included to determine proper wattage and time). Allow the unit to cool for at least two minutes before removing the sterilizer from the microwave. Use the safety grips on the base&mdash;they stay cooler to ensure safer handling. If you don&rsquo;t remove the lid, the contents will stay sterile for up to 24 hours.Care and CleaningThe all-plastic sterilizer is dishwasher safe. Always drain the excess water from the unit and rinse to prevent the build-up of limescale. Always store when the unit is completely dry.What&rsquo;s in the BoxThe Avent Express II Microwave Sterilizer consists of a sturdy plastic base (11 inches in diameter) with safety grips; a bottle/accessory rack with dome cap stem, bottle cavity, nipple cavity, and Isis Breast Pump slots; and a lid with locking clips. It can be used with most standard microwaves with wattage range from 500 to 1,850 watts. The box also contains a detailed and illustrated instruction manual.Note: When taking the sterilizer out of the microwave, use great caution! It will still be hot, as will be the contents. When removing the lid, point it away from you to allow the steam to escape. Follow loading, assembling, and care instructions meticulously.--Emilie Coulter",

Distinct sensations recreate a mother's movements and address the multi-sensory needs of infants. Developed with significant scientific research, the Sweetpeace calms baby via four of the senses: sight, sound, scent, and touch.Sight: Because newborns need visual simplicity, the Sweetpeace is made with neutral colors for a calming effect, has an adjustable canopy to control incoming light, and hosts a mirror that helps baby settle by focusing on their reflection.Sound: Comforting, low-frequency sounds recreate the in utero experience, while high-quality music offers sleepy songs for quiet times or upbeat songs for alert times. There is also a nature sounds (wind, rain, ocean waves) option, or an MP3 plug-in connection and holder allows you to create baby&#x92;s customized playlist.Scent: A parent&#x92;s scent is most recognizable and soothing to baby. The Sweetpeace includes removable soft components (a swaddling blanket and head support) that can be infused with nature&#x92;s \"aromatherapy\" and calm baby with the familiar smells.Touch: A 2-speed vibration calms and relaxes with a subtle \"massage\" while the 5-point harness offers gentle ventral pressure that simulates \"hugging.\" The Soothing Center also moves like mothers do. It has four unique seating positions that imitate how you hold baby, four cradling motions, three recline positions, and six speeds that can be adjusted to baby&#x92;s mood.No tools are necessary to assemble the Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center.Babies (and parents) are calmed by the Sweetpeace&#x92;s multi-sensory technology.As if all of this wasn&#x92;t enough to make you wish you had one of these when you were a baby, Graco threw in some other thoughtful features.

For 11 years, the firm fabricated machine and car parts for local manufacturers. In 1953, Gray left the firm, leaving Cone as sole owner. Cone decided to manufacture his own line of products, but had trouble coming up with ideas. Enter David Saint, an engineer, tinkerer, and stained glass artisan who worked for Graco. Saint, himself a father of nine, was intrigued when an associate told him how his wife would soothe their tired and cranky baby while swinging in a backyard glider swing. Acting on this inspiration, he went to the drawing board and 18 months of hard work later, the world's first wind-up infant swing, the Graco Swyngomatic, was born. Graco sold millions of Swyngomatics in the coming years, becoming one of the world's leading manufacturers of juvenile products in the process. Today, Graco is a Newell Rubbermaid company, with 1500 associates worldwide. While a half-century has brought many changes to Graco, their dedication and commitment to designing and manufacturing top-quality products remains, and continues on.What's In the BoxGraco SnugRide Infant Car Seat Base (Metallic Silver).Learn more about Graco Classic Connect vs Click Connect compatibility here.",

  "Snappi Cloth Diaper Fasteners - Toddler Size 2 - Pack of 2 (Mint Green, White) Pack of 2 in TODDLER SIZE (white, mint green)\n\nThe Snappi is a safer, more reliable, EASY to use fastener for cloth diapers that replaces the nasty diaper pins. The stretchable non-toxic Snappi hooks into the diaper material to make a strong closure. They work best with diapers that have a loose enough weave for the Snappi to hook into. (terry cloth diapers, cotton pre-folds, and others) They do not work well with flannel or other tightly woven diapers.\n\nThe TODDLER SIZE is better suited for larger babies and young toddlers. It is longer across the top 'T' of the Snappi. Once stretched correctly, the Snappi fastener gives an additonal 4\" stretch across the width than the Size 1 Snappi. It comfortably fits up to a 30\" waist. \n\nAGE RECOMMENDATION: Although this depends largely on the size and shape of the baby or toddler, we recommend using the Size 2 Snappi for children aged 16 months+ \n\nWARNING: Do NOT use a Snappi fastener on toddlers who have the ability to undo their cover and take off their diaper and/or clothes. \n\nHow to use your Snappi:\n\nTo improve elasticity, stretch your Snappi fastener a few times before use.\n\nStep 1: Hook left\n\nStep 2: Stretch across and hook right\n\nStep 3: Stretch down and hook center\n\nThe Snappi should go from a \"T\" shape to a \"Y\" shape when stretched properly.\n\nWarning: Always use a cover over a Snappi fastener. Keep out of children's reach when not in use. Do not use a Snappi fastener on toddlers that have the ability to undo or take off their cover/diaper/clothes. Do not use your Snappi for longer than 6 months. Not UV resistant - exposure to the sun can reduce the effectiveness of the Snappi.\n\nCAUTION: Any tear in the Snappi can lead to separation of a piece, presenting a possible choking hazard. Inspect the Snappi before each use and discontinue using immediately if there is any sign of cracking, tearing, breakage or wear of the teeth or any other parts. Do not cut a Snappi as this may cause tearing.",

  "RLR Laundry Treatment and Cloth Diaper Stripper RLR Laundry Treatment is one of the best and easiest product used to strip your cloth diapers. It gets the extra detergent and build up OUT of your cloth diapers!! It's not a soap or detergent, it's a laundry treatment. During a regular wash, mineral deposits, soil sediment and residual matter from detergent can all accumulate in your fabrics causing it to look dingy. Using RLR removes that build-up, leaving whites whiter and colors brighter without using bleach or bluing agents. RLR Laundry Treatment works by removing these particles from the clothing, holding them in suspension in the water and preventing them from redepositing so they rinse away &amp; leave fabric looking like new. We recommend using RLR Laundry Treatment as a preventative every 30-60 days or when a problem with leaks or smelly diapers occur. Directions for stripping your cloth diapers: Fill washer to highest setting with warm water, add 1 packet of RLR for top loaders or 1/2 packet for front loaders. Next add up to 60 diaper items (30 inserts, 30 diapers or 20 diapers 40 inserts etc.) Soak for 30 minutes and then run a normal wash cycle. Rinse &amp; spin twice, hang dry diaper shells &amp; dry your inserts in the dryer. RLR Laundry Treatment contains no dyes, perfumes or phosphates, is completely bio-degradable and non-polluting.",

This is why we love the idea of a baby swing; we've seen how they provide a comfortable, safe place for an infant, with soothing, rocking motions to help maintain a very important sense of security and calm. If you're familiar with older models of baby swings -- with their creaky mechanical noises and uncomfortable seats -- you should know that the Zen Collection swing definitely takes baby swings to another level.The swing's seat is designed for infants who cannot yet sit unassisted. Its basket shape provides security and support for the youngest babies, and it can be adjusted to sit the baby up or recline down. A plush seat cover, padded head support, and built-in cover keep baby comfortable. The swing seat can be positioned to move back and forth or from side to side, and it has a speed-control dial to allow for a variety of graduated speed settings. The swing is powered by battery or can be plugged in with the included adapter. It moves in a smooth, quiet motion with minimal mechanical noise. While baby is swinging, he can listen to one of 14 different soothing sounds with adjustable volume, including Muzak-esque remixes of classical favorites and unobtrusive nature sounds, like chirping birds and babbling brooks.Knowing parents will especially appreciate that the baby seat is removable and portable. So once baby falls asleep in the swing, you don't have to disturb him by removing him from the seat. Just lift the seat out of the swing to carry him with you to different rooms in your home.It's So Lovely!A baby swing is not small -- it's basically a piece of furniture. So we're delighted to find that the Zen Collection swing offers a contemporary and sophisticated palette that can complement your home's d&eacute;cor without making your house look like one big nursery. You won't find any frills or pastel colors here. Its contemporary pattern features sprays of leaves and dragonfly silhouettes in stylish tones of cream, chocolate brown, and moss green with ruby-red accents.Its lovely textural touches include wood-finished handles, satin accents, and embroidered detailing on the cover, as well as on the mobile toys, which are cute and stylish. The toys include two plush dragonflies and a plush turtle, topped with matching umbrellas. It stands on a sturdy, dark brown, metal frame that's heavy enough to provide good support and security. Not only is this swing good looking, it also makes a great choice for unisex decorating.Easy Assembly, Sturdy ConstructionThe swing took us less than half an hour to assemble and required only a Phillips screwdriver. One minor problem: we had to re-thread the mobile so it could hang properly. The assembled swing has a 26-by-33-inch footprint and stands 47 inches tall with the mobile attached, so it takes up quite a bit of room. This is something to consider if you have limited living space. However, the base folds together easily, so you can lean it against a wall when it's not in use.What's in the BoxRemovable infant seat, mobile, swing motor, swing frame components for assembly.",

The Woombie does not unravel as other methods do because of its flexible 4way stretch fabric and easy in/out zipper. This helps maintain the comfort levels of both baby and parent, easing undue stress and promoting a more peaceful environment, which is greatly needed and appreciated during the first few months of life during transition from the womb.NOTE: HAT NOT INCLUDED",

  "Deluxe Snuggle Nest - Blue Patchwork Co-sleeping is one of the sweetest, most convenient approaches to sleep during the early months (or years) of a baby&#x92;s life, especially when Mom is breastfeeding. And although \"overlying,\" or rolling over on a baby, is extremely rare (and is usually related to drinking or drug use in the parents), the Snuggle Nest is a nifty little resource for parents who want a little added security while bonding with their infant. Fitting between the pillows of the adult bed, the nest consists of three sturdy walls to help protect infants from suffocation from pillows and entrapment between the mattress and headboard. A firm mattress provides a safe sleeping surface, and a removable, washable envelope sheet also decreases risks of suffocation from loose sheeting. The open end allows easy access for touching, soothing, and nursing baby. This translates to less crying for baby and more sleep for Mom and Dad! The Snuggle Nest also includes a movable light and breathable mesh-covered sleep positioners to keep baby snug and in place. Traveling? Fold it up and away you go!

  "Joovy Room2 Ultralight Playard Black The Joovy Room2 Ultralight takes all of the popular features of our Room2 playard and eliminates the only complaint we've ever gotten on the Room2 (too heavy). At just over 21 pounds, it's over 30% lighter than the Room2. The Ultralight is 90% as big as the Room2 (it's 9 square feet vs. 10 square feet). The difference is due to the tapered design of the side rails; the top rails are 4 \" shorter than the bottom rails. This design significantly increases the difficulty of climbing out of the playard and makes the Room2 Ultralight super stable. The fact that the Ultralight uses the ground as its floorboard decreases the weight and increases stability too. It has an awesome, super comfortable memory foam mattress and a Joovy 100% brushed cotton sheet (very popular feature). The Ultralight has two easy folding features, it can be quickly folded in half or super compact for travel. When folded in half, it takes up only 3.5 square feet of storage space you can put it next to the wall, underneath the bed, behind the door or in a closet and it unsnaps back to full size in seconds. The Ultralight is perfect for travel; it folds into a compact size and fits right into the travel bag (included). Another clever feature is a solid 600D side panel instead of mesh; it acts as a protective curtain against wind, light and noise on one side of the playard. Positioned properly this can be a huge feature at nap/bed time. There's a large pocket on the outer side it's great for storing all of the essentials. The playard and travel bag are made of durable 600D fabric. Joovy's Room2 playards are the biggest, most durable playards on the market today. The fitted cotton sheet adds a level of comfort un-matched in the industry. Now you can have all that and more in a lighter weight, better looking playard that outperforms everything else.",

BALTIC AMBER TEETHING JEWELRY? The Art of Cure Brand AND Trademark is dedicated to providing the highest quality for Teething Babies. Baltic amber Jewelry is made for wearing (not chewing) when a baby is teething to reduce inflammation in the body. The warmth from the skin releases the active ingredient in the Baltic amber, succinic acid. Recent scientific research has proved that succinic acid has a very positive influence on the human body. It improves immunity and the balance of acids when absorbed into the bloodstream; it stimulates the thyroid glands to help reduce drooling when used for teething and soothes red inflamed cheeks. Amber's anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties are recognized by allopathic medicine as a natural analgesic, which will help to relieve teething pain and calm a baby without resorting to drugs. The skin's warmth releases healing oils from the amber, a resin, which is absorbed into the bloodstream. Parent supervision is recommended at all times. They are 12-12.5 in. Packaging is custom from The Art of Cure and comes with a Keepsake pouch. The Art of Cure Baltic Amber is guaranteed to be of the highest quality and made to the best standards.

  "Dandelion Diapers 100% Organic Cotton DSQ Prefolds Dozen - Size 0 Dandelion prefold diapers are 100% unbleached, organic cotton twill, certified organic to the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) which is the highest standard of organics in the industry. These diaper service quality (DSQ) prefolds are available in traditional prefold dimensions which allow the diapers to be folded down in front or back, or twisted into a bikini fold. Also available are prefolds which offer a more modern cut; a bit wider and shorter than traditional prefolds. The more modern sizing of our Pinless Prefolds allow the diapers to be used with a Snappi fastener for a longer period of time, or simply tucked inside a diaper cover without a fastener at all (lay-in style). But don't let the name fool you; our pinless prefolds still work great with pins! Dandelion DSQ Prefolds are constructed with a triple panel design (extra layers in the center panel), reinforced stitching and extra soft organic cotton which needs only a single prep-wash before initial use (although they will become most absorbent after 3-5 washes). Dandelion organic cotton is not sprayed, treated or finished which results in a superior strength and allows the diapers to quilt and fluff up after only a few washes.",

  "Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer Bleary-eyed parents who scramble to heat bottles in the middle of the night while their baby screams will rejoice at the simplicity and speed with which the Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer warms milk (and food) to just the right temperature. All they need to do is place the filled bottle in the warmer, fill the warmer with water, plug in, and wait for the neon light to flash on and off. In four to six minutes, baby has his bottle.The DetailsWhether a parent is heating breastmilk, formula, or pureed peas; using Avent bottles, other brands, or baby food jars; the Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer gently and evenly heats baby&#x92;s meal. The included plastic basket is used inside the warmer to keep baby food jars and Avent bottles upright. It can be removed when heating the Avent Magic cup and other makes of bottles. Water is added to just above the level of the milk in the bottle (or below the top of baby food jar). Plug the unit into an electrical outlet and click the switch on. A neon light will illuminate. Turn the dial to the appropriate setting (3 for Avent feeding bottles and baby food jars, and 2 for Avent Disposable System). When the bottle has been in the warmer for the appropriate length of time (a guide is included, based on whether the bottle is at room temperature or refrigerated to start), the light will flash. Test the temperature and reheat if necessary or serve.Don&#x92;t forget to switch the warmer off and unplug it!Why Not Just Use the Microwave?The microwave is never recommended for heating baby bottles or food. It&#x92;s difficult to judge just how much time is needed, and even brief heating can create \"hot spots,\" which can burn baby. In addition, important nutrients may be lost in microwave heating.How About Just Putting the Bottle in a Bowl of Warm Water?Sure, if you (and your baby) don&#x92;t mind standing by the sink waiting for the water from the tap to warm up, then waiting for the bottle to warm, checking, checking again, and again&#x85;Get Out of the KitchenMidnight runs back and forth to the kitchen are not high on the list of favorite activities for most parents. A pleasant bonus to using the Avent Express Warmer is that it can be set up in the bedroom, bathroom, nursery&#x85;anywhere there is an outlet. Having the bottle warmer and fixings set up close to the action (not too close, though&#x97;mind the safety precautions) can subtract minutes from the whole process. And as any parent will tell you, every minute counts.What&#x92;s in the BoxThe Avent Express warming system includes bottle-warming unit, basket, feeding spoon, four-ounce Avent bottle with top (nipple not included), and instruction manual with time/temperature guide. All Avent products work together and are completely interchangeable.Note: It is possible to overheat a bottle or jar of food with this system. If you find that a bottle is not warm enough after the allotted time, you may replace it in the warmer, but remember that, although the water surrounding the bottle will remain at a constant temperature, the contents of the bottle or jar will continue to heat. Always test the milk or food before feeding baby. Use all normal and necessary safeguards when using this electrical appliance.--Emilie Coulter",

The stretchable non-toxic Snappi hooks into the diaper material to make a strong closure. They work best with diapers that have a loose enough weave for the Snappi to hook into. (Snappi terry cloth diapers, cotton pre-folds, and others) Note they do not work well with flannel or other tightly woven diapers.\n\nHow to use your Snappi:\n\nTo improve elasticity, stretch your Snappi fastener a few times before use.\n\nStep 1: Hook left\n\nStep 2: Stretch across and hook right\n\nStep 3: Stretch down and hook center\n\nThe Snappi should go from a \"T\" shape to a \"Y\" shape when stretched properly.\n\nWarning: Always use a cover over a Snappi fastener. Keep out of children's reach when not in use. Do not use a Snappi fastener on toddlers that have the ability to undo or take off their cover/diaper/clothes. Do not use your Snappi for longer than 6 months. Not UV resistant - exposure to the sun can reduce the effectiveness of the Snappi.\n\nCAUTION: Any tear in the Snappi can lead to separation of a piece, presenting a possible choking hazard. Inspect the Snappi before each use and discontinue using immediately if there is any sign of cracking, tearing, breakage or wear of the teeth or any other parts. Do not cut a Snappi as this may cause tearing.\n\nNew, never used.",

This is why we love the idea of a baby swing; we've seen how they provide a comfortable, safe place for an infant, with soothing, rocking motions to help maintain a very important sense of security and calm. If you're familiar with older models of baby swings -- with their creaky mechanical noises and uncomfortable seats -- you should know that the Zen Collection swing definitely takes baby swings to another level.The swing's seat is designed for infants who cannot yet sit unassisted. Its basket shape provides security and support for the youngest babies, and it can be adjusted to sit the baby up or recline down. A plush seat cover, padded head support, and built-in cover keep baby comfortable. The swing seat can be positioned to move back and forth or from side to side, and it has a speed-control dial to allow for a variety of graduated speed settings. The swing is powered by battery or can be plugged in with the included adapter. It moves in a smooth, quiet motion with minimal mechanical noise. While baby is swinging, he can listen to one of 14 different soothing sounds with adjustable volume, including Muzak-esque remixes of classical favorites and unobtrusive nature sounds, like chirping birds and babbling brooks.Knowing parents will especially appreciate that the baby seat is removable and portable. So once baby falls asleep in the swing, you don't have to disturb him by removing him from the seat. Just lift the seat out of the swing to carry him with you to different rooms in your home.It's So Lovely!A baby swing is not small -- it's basically a piece of furniture. So we're delighted to find that the Zen Collection swing offers a contemporary and sophisticated palette that can complement your home's d&eacute;cor without making your house look like one big nursery. You won't find any frills or pastel colors here. Its contemporary pattern features sprays of leaves and dragonfly silhouettes in stylish tones of cream, chocolate brown, and moss green with ruby-red accents.Its lovely textural touches include wood-finished handles, satin accents, and embroidered detailing on the cover, as well as on the mobile toys, which are cute and stylish. The toys include two plush dragonflies and a plush turtle, topped with matching umbrellas. It stands on a sturdy, dark brown, metal frame that's heavy enough to provide good support and security. Not only is this swing good looking, it also makes a great choice for unisex decorating.Easy Assembly, Sturdy ConstructionThe swing took us less than half an hour to assemble and required only a Phillips screwdriver. One minor problem: we had to re-thread the mobile so it could hang properly. The assembled swing has a 26-by-33-inch footprint and stands 47 inches tall with the mobile attached, so it takes up quite a bit of room. This is something to consider if you have limited living space. However, the base folds together easily, so you can lean it against a wall when it's not in use.What's in the BoxRemovable infant seat, mobile, swing motor, swing frame components for assembly.",

The Avent Express II Microwave Sterilizer is a modern-day technological wonder&hellip;and a joy for most parents, who will do anything for a little peace of mind and a few extra minutes to spare. Using a regular kitchen microwave, this lightweight sterilizer eliminates household bacteria and keeps contents sterile for up to 24 hours. It can be used to sterilize Avent feeding bottles of varying sizes (and their nipples, rings, and dome caps), Avent Isis breast pump accessories, Via cups and lids, Via Disposable Nursers, and other non-electrical Avent products. Its compact size and ease of use make the sterilizer perfect for traveling, too.Protect Your Baby from BacteriaThe Avent Express II Microwave Sterilizer effectively and quickly kills the kind of household bacteria that can wreak havoc on babies&rsquo; delicate new systems. Establishing a routine of washing bottles and pump supplies in gentle, soapy water, then sterilizing them, will ensure that baby will have a clean start in life.No More Pots and Pans and Boiling WaterThe Avent Express is simplicity itself once you get the hang of it. After reading the detailed instructions with great care (assembly and loading are not completely intuitive, and there are important details that can make all the difference in safety and effectiveness of the sterilizer), pour the correct amount of water into the base. Load the pre-washed bottles and feeding components into the appropriate spots in the plastic rack, position the lid over the sterilizer base and lock the clips into place. (You&rsquo;ll hear a click.) Place the sterilizer in the center of the microwave, and select microwave wattage and timings (a chart is included to determine proper wattage and time). Allow the unit to cool for at least two minutes before removing the sterilizer from the microwave. Use the safety grips on the base&mdash;they stay cooler to ensure safer handling. If you don&rsquo;t remove the lid, the contents will stay sterile for up to 24 hours.Care and CleaningThe all-plastic sterilizer is dishwasher safe. Always drain the excess water from the unit and rinse to prevent the build-up of limescale. Always store when the unit is completely dry.What&rsquo;s in the BoxThe Avent Express II Microwave Sterilizer consists of a sturdy plastic base (11 inches in diameter) with safety grips; a bottle/accessory rack with dome cap stem, bottle cavity, nipple cavity, and Isis Breast Pump slots; and a lid with locking clips. It can be used with most standard microwaves with wattage range from 500 to 1,850 watts. The box also contains a detailed and illustrated instruction manual.Note: When taking the sterilizer out of the microwave, use great caution! It will still be hot, as will be the contents. When removing the lid, point it away from you to allow the steam to escape. Follow loading, assembling, and care instructions meticulously.--Emilie Coulter",

  "The Art of CureTM *SAFETY KNOTTED* Raw chip - Certified Baltic Amber Baby Teething Necklace w/ &quot;The Art of CureTM&quot; Jewelry pouch (SHIPS AND SOLD IN USA) WHAT ALL THE MOMS ARE RAVING ABOUT!!! BALTIC AMBER TEETHING JEWELRY? The Art of Cure Brand AND Trademark is dedicated to providing the highest quality for Teething Babies. Baltic amber Jewelry is made for wearing (not chewing) when a baby is teething to reduce inflammation in the body. The warmth from the skin releases the active ingredient in the Baltic amber, succinic acid. Recent scientific research has proved that succinic acid has a very positive influence on the human body. It improves immunity and the balance of acids when absorbed into the bloodstream; it stimulates the thyroid glands to help reduce drooling when used for teething and soothes red inflamed cheeks. Amber's anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties are recognized by allopathic medicine as a natural analgesic, which will help to relieve teething pain and calm a baby without resorting to drugs. The skin's warmth releases healing oils from the amber, a resin, which is absorbed into the bloodstream. Parent supervision is recommended at all times. They are 12-12.5 in. Packaging is custom from The Art of Cure and comes with a Keepsake pouch. The Art of Cure Baltic Amber is guaranteed to be of the highest quality and made to the best standards.

Featuring a leak-resistant double-zip closure embedded into the seal at an angle that reduces pressure buildup and a top spout design that kids love! Measuring lines on the semi-translucent pouch make portion control a breeze and a sturdy bottom gusset expands to hold 5 oz (150ml) of semi-solid food as well as allows the pouch to stand upright when full! \nThe GoFreshBaby food pouch has a very secure double zip seal closure that prevents the pouch from opening or rupturing under pressure.  To open, unscrew the cap and blow air into the pouch until bottom gusset is fully expanded.  Pull apart the double zip closure by applying firm pressure with thumbs directly at the seal.  Be careful not to tear the zip seal lining by pulling at the tab extensions aggressively!  \n\nFilling the pouch is easy and convenient thanks to the double zip seal opening and expandable bottom gusset.   To fill, open the reusable pouch and be sure the bottom gusset is completely expanded. Hold pouch so that the zip seal opening faces up with the cap securely tightened. Pour semi-solid food directly into the opening using a measuring cup or funnel. Seal and wipe away any excess food. \n\nTo clean, we recommend washing by hand in warm soapy water. A bottle brush is great for cleaning the inside and hard to reach areas around the expandable bottom gusset.  Rinse thoroughly and let air dry completely.  Top rack dishwasher safe!",

  "The First Years Close and Secure Sleeper The First Years deceptively simple Close & Secure Sleeper allows you to feed, soothe, monitor, and bond with baby in the comfort of your own bed. Meant to be used from birth until baby rolls over or pushes up on their own, the sleeper is anchored to your bed by a large flap that tucks under your mattress. The patented Airflow design of the hollow frame and breathable mesh fabric keep air circulating and baby cool.The sleeper folds up nicely for convenient portability and compact storage.A durable, cloth-covered U-shaped \"wall\" surrounds baby&#x92;s head and torso to limit their movement and help prevent parents from rolling onto them. The soft head barrier reduces the risk of entrapment, while the foot wedge--which can be used as a sleep positioner in future months--ensures baby stays snugly inside the sleep area. The supportive bottom is a cozy resting spot with the included soft cover, vinyl covered mattress, and removable, machine washable mattress sheet.Reassurance and safety weren&#x92;t the only things The First Years folks thought of when creating this sleeper. Other benefits include its portability, a nightlight, and transitional use. For travel convenience, the Close & Secure folds up easily, is lightweight, and sports a carrying handle. Once baby has outgrown it, this feature means that it can also be compactly stored until needed again. A built-in nightlight allows you to quietly check on your bundle of joy during the night and provides enough illumination for feedings without waking your partner.

For 11 years, the firm fabricated machine and car parts for local manufacturers. In 1953, Gray left the firm, leaving Cone as sole owner. Cone decided to manufacture his own line of products, but had trouble coming up with ideas. Enter David Saint, an engineer, tinkerer, and stained glass artisan who worked for Graco. Saint, himself a father of nine, was intrigued when an associate told him how his wife would soothe their tired and cranky baby while swinging in a backyard glider swing. Acting on this inspiration, he went to the drawing board and 18 months of hard work later, the world's first wind-up infant swing, the Graco Swyngomatic, was born. Graco sold millions of Swyngomatics in the coming years, becoming one of the world's leading manufacturers of juvenile products in the process. Today, Graco is a Newell Rubbermaid company, with 1500 associates worldwide. While a half-century has brought many changes to Graco, their dedication and commitment to designing and manufacturing top-quality products remains, and continues on.What's in the BoxGraco DuoGlider LX Double Stroller (Fortune).",

Fill, close, and feed. This has taken you 10-15 seconds. Steri-bottle has been feeding babies and saving U.K. Moms and dads thousands and thousands of hours of bottle washing and sterilizing.

The simulation mode simulates your baby's initial rapid sucking to start your milk flowing, while the expression mode simulates your baby's slower, deeper suckling to express your milk gently yet efficiently. These modes work together to make pumping a quick and painless process.Convenient, Safe and User-Friendly DesignMedela knows that busy moms don't have the time or patience to struggle with complicated parts or to wait for the pump to stimulate milk flow. That's why the Harmony is designed for faster let-down.Additionally, this one-piece unit features fewer pieces to assemble and clean than traditional manual pumps, making it a snap to start pumping when and where you need to. Most importantly, the Harmony is a safe and sanitary way to provide your baby with healthy breast milk--all parts that come into contact with breast milk are 100-percent BPA/DEHP free. For added convenience, this pump is also upgradeable to electric pumping with the use of the Symphony or the Lactina conversion kits (not included), and it is backed with a 30-day limited warranty.About MedelaFounded in 1961 in Zug, Switzerland by Olle Larsson, Medela is committed to supporting the WHO Code's depiction of breastfeeding and breast milk as the optimal nutrition for the growth, development and health of babies.

  "2-in-1 Professional Clinical RY210 Large LCD Non-contact Infrared Thermometer - Forehead and Surface The Santa Medical non-contact infrared (IR) clinical thermometer provides a simple, expedient, and accurate way for initial fever screenings by taking the temperature of areas on the face such as the forehead or tear ducts. It obtains the body temperature reading with 0.3 degree accuracy in less than 1 second. The Santa Medical IR thermometer features an intuitive guidance system to secure positioning and confirm accurate readings. Temperatures (Fahrenheit or Celsius) are displayed on a huge back-lit LCD screen for easier reading even in total darkness. Adjustable audio alarm will alert you if the temperature is too high. Since there is no contamination risk, one can immediately start again to scan the temperature of other family members or individuals without having to disinfect or changing the tip. Santa Medical Thermometer was designed specifically for forehead temperature detection from a 1\"-4\" (5-15cm) distance with an 89-109 F(32.0-43.0C) temperature range. Unlike other IR thermometers that only measure surface temperature, Santa Medical Thermometer is clinically calibrated to convert the forehead temperature reading(external surface) into internal body temperature which is one of the most important vital signs for human being. It can also store 32 temperature readings for future reference. The bright back-lit LCD screen displays readings even in darkness. A sleeping baby or patient will not be disturbed by the Thermometer as it is used nor will it cause any discomfort if they are awake. For public health authorities, it provides a simple, quick, Non-contact, and non-invasive way to perform preliminary mass-screening for H1N1 fever (swine flu) infection symptoms (body temperatures above 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit or 37 degrees Celsius). Santa Medical Thermometer can take over 100,000 readings on a single set of 2 AA batteries (included). With its rugged, impact and water resistant design, it is able to take over 3,000,000 measurements in the product's lifetime.",

  "The First Years Hands Free Gate Because of its simple \"knee-knocker\" mechanism, this Hands Free Gate can do exactly what the name implies: be opened without having to use your hands. Any parent occupied with little ones and all of their necessities will quickly recognize this as a huge benefit. To operate, simply press on the pedal with your toes and then bump the knee plate with your knee. Closing is just a nudge in the opposite direction; you will hear a click when the latch has caught, offering peace of mind that it&#x92;s secure again.The convenient foot pedal is easy for adults, but difficult for children, to open.The pedal, knee plate, and hinges are designed so the gate can swing open from either direction. Even smarter is that the gate is purposely designed as easy-to-open for an adult, yet difficult for children. The gate&#x92;s vertical bars curb curious toddlers from trying to climb over, are spaced to help prevent painful accidents, and provide ample visibility through to the other side.Adjustable pressure mounts don&#x92;t require screws and won&#x92;t mark up your walls.Able to fit in standard doorframes (29\" to 34\" wide), the all-metal safety gate is a pressure-mount device. Just twist the adjustable bolts at each of the four corners to get a proper, secure fit in your doorways. (If you have wider than standard doors, The First Years sells extension kits separately that can accommodate up to 44-inch wide openings.) It should be noted that this safety gate can be a little unsteady when used at the outer limits of its range, so you may want to consider an extension kit even if using in a standard doorway.Before you buy, there are two things to be aware of. One, the actual opening for parents, kids, and/or pets to walk through is only about 18 inches wide. Two, if you want to use this in a doorway and be able to close the door, the foot pedal sticks out too far to allow this. For use with children up to 24 months.",
  "Joovy Room2 Ultralight Playard Black The Joovy Room2 Ultralight takes all of the popular features of our Room2 playard and eliminates the only complaint we've ever gotten on the Room2 (too heavy). At just over 21 pounds, it's over 30% lighter than the Room2. The Ultralight is 90% as big as the Room2 (it's 9 square feet vs. 10 square feet). The difference is due to the tapered design of the side rails; the top rails are 4 \" shorter than the bottom rails. This design significantly increases the difficulty of climbing out of the playard and makes the Room2 Ultralight super stable. The fact that the Ultralight uses the ground as its floorboard decreases the weight and increases stability too. It has an awesome, super comfortable memory foam mattress and a Joovy 100% brushed cotton sheet (very popular feature). The Ultralight has two easy folding features, it can be quickly folded in half or super compact for travel. When folded in half, it takes up only 3.5 square feet of storage space you can put it next to the wall, underneath the bed, behind the door or in a closet and it unsnaps back to full size in seconds. The Ultralight is perfect for travel; it folds into a compact size and fits right into the travel bag (included). Another clever feature is a solid 600D side panel instead of mesh; it acts as a protective curtain against wind, light and noise on one side of the playard. Positioned properly this can be a huge feature at nap/bed time. There's a large pocket on the outer side it's great for storing all of the essentials. The playard and travel bag are made of durable 600D fabric. Joovy's Room2 playards are the biggest, most durable playards on the market today. The fitted cotton sheet adds a level of comfort un-matched in the industry. Now you can have all that and more in a lighter weight, better looking playard that outperforms everything else.",

  "Lipper International 516P High Chair, Pecan When a toddler first has the opportunity to eat a meal from the same surface as one's parents, the experience often imbues the young child with a great sense of achievement and importance. The significance is clear: the child has developed skills that he or she did not previously possess. Once the toddler achieves this dexterity, the baby high chair with its dinky tray no longer has a place at the dinner table. However, a toddler still requires a boost to reach the dinner plate, necessitating a tray-less high chair. Familiar from use in family restaurants around the world, this Lipper International wooden high chair offers toddlers a secure seat for tableside eating. Lipper designed the chair for children 1- to 3-1/2- years old, or up to 35 pounds in weight. Simple yet practical, the high chair aesthetically blends into many kitchen and dining room d&#xE9;cors with ease.The high chair prevents tipping with its durable and weighty beech wood construction and a sturdy 19-1/2-by-21-inch base. The seat stands 20 inches from the floor, while the armrest dowel hovers 7 inches over the seat. A 9-inch high seatback with a broad wooden slat keeps the child sitting upright. A 3-point safety strap system secures the child with a lap belt, which threads through the crouch restraint. To reduce splinter potential, a non-toxic pecan finish smoothes the wood surface. Subtly rounded corners also decrease the risk of injuries. Easy to clean, wipe the high chair down with a damp cloth. Use a mild soap on marks and dry immediately to prevent water damage. Upon delivery, the chair requires some assembly with tools. The Thailand-made chair also comes with cherry or natural finishes. The high chair measures 20 by 19-3/4 by 28-3/4 inches and weighs 16 pounds upon shipping.--Jessica Reuling",

Imagine the convenience of a disposable diaper but for baby bottles. Trusted by UK parents since 2000, Steri-bottle is the safe and simple way to feed your baby anytime, at home, or on the move. Steri-bottle is 100% BPA-free and phthalate-free, and is 100% recyclable. Steri-bottle is designed with care in the U.K. and made with pride in the USA. Each package contains 5 or 10 complete bottles and nipples. Steri-bottle is pre-sterilized and ready to use out of the box because the bottles and nipples are manufactured at high heat in a clean-room facility in Buffalo Grove, Illinois. No human hands touch the sterile bottles and nipples - the manufacturing and packaging process is automated. Use Steri-bottle when traveling. You used to pack an extra bag with clean bottles, nipples, brushes, and maybe even a sterilizing kit. You used to stay up late washing bottles when everyone else was asleep. Now, just open the Steri-bottle package, remove one pre-sterilized bottle and nipple. They're ready to use. Fill the bottle, warm it up, close the lid, and feed your child. When you're done, you can recycle the entire Steri-bottle. Use Steri-bottle at home. It's 3 a.m. &#x2013; it's time for a routine feed. Suddenly, you realize that there are no sterilized bottles in the cupboard. And you have to be at work in the morning and desperately want a few more minutes of sleep. There's no need to spend up to 10 minutes or more washing used bottles while half-asleep. Now you can just reach for a Steri-bottle. Open the box, take out a pre-sterilized bottle and nipple. Fill, close, and feed. This has taken you 10-15 seconds. Steri-bottle has been feeding babies and saving U.K. Moms and dads thousands and thousands of hours of bottle washing and sterilizing. When you can enjoy a few more moments, or go back to sleep faster, you will see why we say that Steri-bottle saves you time and more.",

The two arms can be attached to make a head support by overlapping the ends of the right arm (Velcro arm) and the left arm. The Velcro under the right arm sticks to the white portion on the upper side of the left arm to create a secure attachment which prevents the head from falling through the opening. The circular opening of the pod cradles the back of the head while providing comfortable placement and optimal positioning. The length of the white portion allows the pod to be adjusted to various sizes.  Neck Support - Recommended for 6 Months to 12 Months. Once the two arms are detached, the Velcro should be covered with the Peak-a-Boo cover located on the upper side of the right arm. The Peak-a-Boo cover is the self-fabric flap which should be turned inside out to hide the Velcro in order to avoid irritation to the skin.

Made of machine-washable, 100 percent cotton, the carrier can be easily adjusted from  the front for your baby's size.

  "Traveling Toddler Car Seat Travel Accessory ATTN: Britax owners. If our product is too short, please check to be sure your LATCH straps are in the forward facing position. Whether flying on an airplane or traveling by train or bus, it is safest and most comfortable for your child to be in a car seat. But traveling with a young child, their seat, and your carry-on can be tricky. Not anymore. The Traveling Toddler strap allows you to attach your LATCH and top tether equipped toddler's car seat to a rolling carry-on suitcase. Simply attach the LATCH and top tether straps from the car seat to the Traveling Toddler and adjust the straps so that the car seat is held securely on the suitcase. Once adjusted, the car seat can be detached and reattached to the suitcase in seconds. Lift the handle of your carry-on bag and you have a fun new stroller. Now there's an easy and inexpensive way to take your toddler's car seat and other gear on your trip. You do not have to buy a special seat or suitcase. As long as your suitcase handle locks in place, you can push it like a stroller. Your hands are free for check in and its simple to unhook for security. Keep your child safe and comfortable in their own seat. The Traveling Toddler has been tested with most major car seat brands including Graco, Eddie Bauer, Cosco, Evenflo, and Britax, and a variety of carry-on suitcases and has worked with every combination. It is important that the telescoping handle of your suitcase locks in place. If not, it might not stay extended when you try to push your child in front of you, though you would still be able to pull them. If flying, make sure that your car seat is FAA approved before traveling. The Traveling Toddler strap is made from heavyweight polypropylene webbing that will withstand 900 lbs of force. When not in use it easily slips in the pocket of your carry-on. As with any other wheeled child carrier, do not use the Traveling Toddler on stairs or escalators.

  "Little Dundi My Early Steps Baby Walker, Tan My Early Steps is a soft-structured baby walker for use with infants who have demonstrated an ability to stand while supporting themselves against furniture or holding onto an adult's hand. This is indicative of completed changes in bodily proportion and sufficient leg muscle strength needed to enable the ability to balance in upright posture. My Early Steps is recommended for use with infants with a minimum chest circumference of 19 inches, weighing less than 30 pounds, and at least 8 months old. The unique shell design promotes a natural posture for baby &#x2013; the arms are used for balancing, which is key to maintaining balance while transitioning from one foot to the other, and the risk of shoulder dislocation caused by assisting adults pulling on baby&#x2019;s arms is minimized. Baby receives visual feedback related to each step as the view of baby's feet is unobstructed. The processing of such visual feedback by the brain is essential for independent walking. The adult also benefits from maintaining a natural, upright posture while using the walker. The lower part of the walker absorbs part of baby's weight and prevents the top part from gathering up under baby's arms during use, causing them to extend upwards. The wide leg openings allow for free leg movement and baby can gradually build up the upper muscle strength required for independent walking. The most unique feature of My Early Steps is the three-point fastening on the back. Situated close to the center of gravity of the baby it includes the lower point of attachment of the support straps. This is important because babies' center of gravity lies much higher than that of adults, making them top heavy. Positioning the point of attachment of the support straps close to the center of gravity affords better control for the adult and increased support for the top heavy infant. The support straps are easily removable and adjustable in length to accommodate adults of various heights. Babies can frequently tire of walking practice and want to switch to crawling. It is possible to let baby crawl without undue risk of entanglement - no need to remove the entire baby walker from baby, only the support straps. The three-point fastening allows for adjustments for baby's height and chest circumference (or thicker outerwear) and makes it possible to create a snug fi",

  "Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included The Diaper Genie is one of this decade's most talked-about baby  items. By providing a convenient, sanitary storage container for your  dirty diapers, the Diaper Genie will help you keep your nursery and  changing table neat, organized, and odor free. The Wide Opening Diaper  Genie employs a simple yet effective Twistaway disposal system: just  lift up the childproof safety lid, push a dirty diaper into the wide  opening, and twist the inner rim to seal the diaper in a fragrant,  plastic barrier. The lightweight unit uses blue, wide opening Diaper  Genie refills only (original Diaper Genie refills will not fit), and  you can fit up to 25 medium-size diapers into the Genie at one time.  Along with its compact size (19.5 inches high), one nice advantage of  the Genie is that you don't have to empty it over a garbage can. When  it is full you can just unlatch the bottom of the Genie, pull out the  short train of wrapped diapers, and take it out to the garbage can  without making a mess. The Diaper Genie comes with instructions for  assembly.--Chris Burns",

  "Fisher-Price: 49 MHz Sounds 'n Lights Monitor Nervous, first-time parents will appreciate the extreme sensitivity of the Sound &#x91;n Lights monitor. This single-receiver monitor provides two ways to check on what baby is up to in her crib. The sound is clear as a bell so parents can hear even the slightest noises, such as baby&#x92;s breathing or rolling over in her crib, and cries come through loud and strong. As a secondary measure, the receiver also features a light display to keep tabs on baby. A single arc of light on the display suggests that baby is quiet or asleep while a swift climb to four arcs means that baby is most likely making a lot of noise. This light feature is a blessing for parents whose babies cry themselves to sleep as parents can \"see\" if their child is quieting down without having to listen to agonizing screams. Further features include a power indicator light on the base, a volume control, two channels to reduce interference, and the option of using the AC adapter or three \"AA\" batteries (not included) for power. Fisher-Price covers this 900-MHz unit under a one-year limited warranty.--Cristina Vaamonde",

Keep out of children's reach when not in use. Do not use a Snappi fastener on toddlers that have the ability to undo or take off their cover/diaper/clothes. Do not use your Snappi for longer than 6 months. Not UV resistant - exposure to the sun can reduce the effectiveness of the Snappi.\n\nCAUTION: Any tear in the Snappi can lead to separation of a piece, presenting a possible choking hazard. Inspect the Snappi before each use and discontinue using immediately if there is any sign of cracking, tearing, breakage or wear of the teeth or any other parts.

  "The Art of CureTM *SAFETY KNOTTED* Chestnut Bean- Certified Baltic Amber Baby Teething Necklace w/ The Art of CureTM Jewelry Pouch (SHIPS AND SOLD IN USA) WHAT ALL THE MOMS ARE RAVING ABOUT!!! BALTIC AMBER TEETHING JEWELRY? The Art of Cure Brand AND Trademark is dedicated to providing the highest quality for Teething Babies. Baltic amber Jewelry is made for wearing (not chewing) when a baby is teething to reduce inflammation in the body. The warmth from the skin releases the active ingredient in the Baltic amber, succinic acid. Recent scientific research has proved that succinic acid has a very positive influence on the human body. It improves immunity and the balance of acids when absorbed into the bloodstream; it stimulates the thyroid glands to help reduce drooling when used for teething and soothes red inflamed cheeks. Amber's anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties are recognized by allopathic medicine as a natural analgesic, which will help to relieve teething pain and calm a baby without resorting to drugs. The skin's warmth releases healing oils from the amber, a resin, which is absorbed into the bloodstream. Parent supervision is recommended at all times. They are 12-12.5 in. Packaging is custom from The Art of Cure and comes with a Keepsake pouch. The Art of Cure Baltic Amber is guaranteed to be of the highest quality and made to the best standards.

  "green sprouts Natural Wood Ring Rattle For over two decades i play., Inc. has been researching children's health issues to make safer feeding accessories that come in contact with babies' mouths and foods. Due to recent safety issues in children's toys we saw a need for toys free from potentially harmful toxins. So in 2008 we launched a new line of PVC, phthalate, BPA and nitrosamine free toys made from synthetic materials. Inside Baby: Pregnancy and early childhood are critical times in babies' lives because they are growing and developing so rapidly. During this time they are vulnerable to elements in their environment, and parents should protect them as much as possible from exposure to potentially harmful substances. The first priority for growing babies is to make sure everything babies put inside their mouth is healthy, safe and promotes the development of strong immune system.  &#x2022; PVC free and Phthalate free: PolyVinyl Chloride (PVC) is a hard plastic that requires harsh chemical softeners, such as phthalates, to make it appropriate for use in soft plastic baby toys such as squirty toys. In 2003 we discovered that phthalates were shown to disrupt reproductive functions and cause other developmental problems, so we launched a line of toys free from PVC and phthalates.  &#x2022; BPA free: Bisphenol-A (BPA) is used in hard, clear plastics sometimes used in baby toys to prevent breakage. In 2006 we learned that BPA also disrupts reproductive functions and causes other developmental problems, so we added a line of BPA free toys to our line. &#x2022; Nitrosamine free: Nitrosamines are found in latex products such as some infant teethers. They have been shown to cause cancer in many animals, so all our teethers and soothers are nitrosamine free.",

  "Tiny Love Symphony-in-Motion Remote Mobile The original Symphony-in-Motion crib mobiles have long been favorite baby distracters/soothers, with pleasant, not-too-tinny music and spinning colorful critters and whirligigs. The only thing missing has been a remote control so parents could keep the music and action going without disturbing an almost-slumbering baby. Well&#x85;(sound the horns!) enter the Deluxe model! All the appeal of the original, plus a remote. The music box is (easily) attached to the crib bars, and the mobile with swiveling arm ascends from the box to hang over the crib, out of baby&#x92;s reach. One button on the music box starts a 15-minute cycle of music by Mozart, Beethoven, or Bach; or individual composers&#x92; buttons can be pushed if baby has a yen for 15 minutes of Bach, say. Goofy zoo animals sporting polka dots and multi-colored feet (a la Dr. Seuss) are angled to baby&#x92;s line of vision&#x97;not the parent&#x92;s. The arms rotate as the music plays, causing beads to slide with a satisfying click on each turn. All this commotion can, of course, be initiated by the remote as well, which is a powerful feature for parents who know that one glimpse of mama or papa may be enough to get baby riled up again. Once baby is big and strong enough to grab the toys, it&#x92;s time to retire the mobile. But keep that music box around&#x97;baby will love the music forever, and will enjoy pushing the buttons herself one day! Requires two \"AAA\" batteries (not included).--Emilie Coulter",

  "Clek Foonf 2014 Convertible Car Seat, Blue/White Blue Moon Clek combines safety for children with ease of use for parents in the foonf convertible car seat to create the most advanced child safety seat ever made. Features include: rear-facing 14 to 50 pounds; forward-facing 20 to 65 pounds. Unique rigid-latch system makes proper forward-facing installation effortless (the seat slides into place, and the rigid-latch system securely grips the car's built-in lower latch connectors). For improved rear-facing installation, the cushion pops off to provide easy access to the belt path. One of the most effective innovations in automotive safety is the crumple zone--the area of the vehicle that deforms and crumples upon impact, absorbing energy from the impact and preventing force from being transmitted to the vehicle's occupants. Foonf's react safety system borrows that principle to provide optimal safety in forward-facing collision. With the react safety system, an aluminum honeycomb crumples upon impact absorbing the sudden change in momentum, resulting in less force transferred to the child. Optimal side-impact protection - designed with a rigid metal substructure and strategically positioned energy-absorbing foam layers in the body of the seat and in the adjustable headrest- includes a steel anti-rebound bar that braces against the vehicle seat's back, limiting the rotation of the child seat, helping to protect your child's head from impact. Designed at 17\" wide (widest point) making 3-across possible- easy-to-operate recline function- height adjustable crotch buckle - made with green guard select certified crypton super fabrics, which provide permanent protection against stains, moisture, and bacteria; and are free of brominated and chlorinated flame-retardants- foonf is recyclable through Clek's recycling network- 9-year expiration and 1-year manufacturer's limited warranty- manufactured in Canada",

  "green sprouts Rainbow Rattle For over two decades i play., Inc. has been researching children's health issues to make safer feeding accessories that come in contact with babies' mouths and foods. Due to recent safety issues in children's toys we saw a need for toys free from potentially harmful toxins. So in 2008 we launched a new line of PVC, phthalate, BPA and nitrosamine free toys made from synthetic materials. Inside Baby: Pregnancy and early childhood are critical times in babies' lives because they are growing and developing so rapidly. During this time they are vulnerable to elements in their environment, and parents should protect them as much as possible from exposure to potentially harmful substances. The first priority for growing babies is to make sure everything babies put inside their mouth is healthy, safe and promotes the development of strong immune system.  &#x2022; PVC free and Phthalate free: PolyVinyl Chloride (PVC) is a hard plastic that requires harsh chemical softeners, such as phthalates, to make it appropriate for use in soft plastic baby toys such as squirty toys. In 2003 we discovered that phthalates were shown to disrupt reproductive functions and cause other developmental problems, so we launched a line of toys free from PVC and phthalates.  &#x2022; BPA free: Bisphenol-A (BPA) is used in hard, clear plastics sometimes used in baby toys to prevent breakage. In 2006 we learned that BPA also disrupts reproductive functions and causes other developmental problems, so we added a line of BPA free toys to our line. &#x2022; Nitrosamine free: Nitrosamines are found in latex products such as some infant teethers. They have been shown to cause cancer in many animals, so all our teethers and soothers are nitrosamine free.",

  "Clek Foonf 2014 Convertible Car Seat, Blue/White Blue Moon Clek combines safety for children with ease of use for parents in the foonf convertible car seat to create the most advanced child safety seat ever made. Features include: rear-facing 14 to 50 pounds; forward-facing 20 to 65 pounds. Unique rigid-latch system makes proper forward-facing installation effortless (the seat slides into place, and the rigid-latch system securely grips the car's built-in lower latch connectors). For improved rear-facing installation, the cushion pops off to provide easy access to the belt path. One of the most effective innovations in automotive safety is the crumple zone--the area of the vehicle that deforms and crumples upon impact, absorbing energy from the impact and preventing force from being transmitted to the vehicle's occupants. Foonf's react safety system borrows that principle to provide optimal safety in forward-facing collision. With the react safety system, an aluminum honeycomb crumples upon impact absorbing the sudden change in momentum, resulting in less force transferred to the child. Optimal side-impact protection - designed with a rigid metal substructure and strategically positioned energy-absorbing foam layers in the body of the seat and in the adjustable headrest- includes a steel anti-rebound bar that braces against the vehicle seat's back, limiting the rotation of the child seat, helping to protect your child's head from impact. Designed at 17\" wide (widest point) making 3-across possible- easy-to-operate recline function- height adjustable crotch buckle - made with green guard select certified crypton super fabrics, which provide permanent protection against stains, moisture, and bacteria; and are free of brominated and chlorinated flame-retardants- foonf is recyclable through Clek's recycling network- 9-year expiration and 1-year manufacturer's limited warranty- manufactured in Canada",

For 11 years, the firm fabricated machine and car parts for local manufacturers. In 1953, Gray left the firm, leaving Cone as sole owner. Cone decided to manufacture his own line of products, but had trouble coming up with ideas. Enter David Saint, an engineer, tinkerer, and stained glass artisan who worked for Graco. Saint, himself a father of nine, was intrigued when an associate told him how his wife would soothe their tired and cranky baby while swinging in a backyard glider swing. Acting on this inspiration, he went to the drawing board and 18 months of hard work later, the world's first wind-up infant swing, the Graco Swyngomatic, was born. Graco sold millions of Swyngomatics in the coming years, becoming one of the world's leading manufacturers of juvenile products in the process. Today, Graco is a Newell Rubbermaid company, with 1500 associates worldwide. While a half-century has brought many changes to Graco, their dedication and commitment to designing and manufacturing top-quality products remains, and continues on.What's in the BoxGraco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame.",

  "Philips Avent iQ24 Sterilizer with 2 Bottles, 9 oz Baby care requires so much time and vigilant attention. Any appliance that takes the guesswork (and a few precious minutes) out of the endless feeding routine is a blessing to caregivers. The Avent IQ24 Sterilizer is a relatively small, simple appliance that sterilizes up to six (Avent brand) bottles and/or screw rings, nipples, pacifiers, and breast pump components in just six minutes. The contents then stay sterile for six hours, providing the lid is not removed. An optional second mode keeps bottle- and breastfeeding accessories sterile for up to 24 hours by continuously repeating the cycle, so baby can have clean, sterile bottles day and night. And as we know, babies actively require feeding 24/7, so this is no idle bonus!A Sterilizer with an IQThe Avent iQ24 Electronic Steam Sterilizer is so named because the makers consider it an \"intelligent\" product, using \"advanced iQ technology.\" And it really is pretty smart. The machine communicates each phase of the sterilization cycle, so you never have to guess whether the bottles or breast pump accessories are actually sterile yet. A digital display, electronic countdown, and sound alerts give parents the assurance that baby will not be contaminated with the bacteria that lurk in unclean feeding equipment. Another cool feature is the ability to \"pause\" the cycle (again, read the instructions to do this properly!) in order to remove some items without interrupting the cycle.Putting the Sterilizer TogetherAlthough the iQ24 Sterilizer is relatively easy to assemble and use, it&#x92;s not necessarily intuitive. In other words, you&#x92;re probably going to have to read the instruction manual pretty carefully the first time around. After that, it should be a piece of cake. Basically, there is a pot with power cord, a lower basket, a bottle rack, an upper basket (plus a spare upper basket), a lid, measuring cup, and tongs. Two 9-ounce bottles are included, as well, along with nipples, screw rings, and dome caps. The baskets and bottle rack slide onto a central stem, and the bottles and breast pump components are placed in the appropriate baskets or rack. The sterilizer cleverly uses bottle screw rings to separate the baskets and bottle rack, putting the very items to be sterilized to good secondary use! Once the correct amount of water is added and all parts are assembled and loaded (and that&#x92;s the hardest part, figuring out which basket and bottle parts go where), simply plug the sterilizer body into an electrical outlet, select mode one or two (for six-hour or 24-hour sterilization cycles), and wait six minutes (for either mode). You&#x92;ll also need to study the information pamphlet for a translation of the various beeps and flashing lights on the display, but generally it will be obvious when the sterilization cycle has begun and ended, and what to do next (feed that baby!).Dishwasher BasketAs a bonus feature, two baskets can be clipped together to hold small items such as nipples, breast pump parts, pacifiers, etc., for washing in the top rack of your dishwasher prior to sterilization. Keep in mind that Avent items may discolor over time if they are washed in the dishwasher with dirty dishes covered with remnants of strong sauces, such as tomato or curry sauce.Note: Sterilization is not the same as, nor should it replace, washing! All bottles and breast pump supplies should be washed carefully in mild, soapy water, and rinsed, before sterilizing. Also, for optimal effectiveness of the sterilizer, and to reduce limescale build-up, use distilled water for sterilizing. Regardless of whether you use tap or distilled water, you should de-scale the sterilizer every four weeks or so (read manual for instructions).--Emilie Coulter",

  "Easy Stroll One Handed Stroller Grip, Black Easy Stroll works on most strollers that have standard handles with rubber or foam hand grips. Easy Stroll does not work with umbrella type stroller handles, pistol grip handles, or strollers with hard plastic hand grips. One hand operation of a stroller is now possible with Easy Stroll. Previously, pushing a stroller with one hand was cumbersome at best. And, if you were successful, it usually resulted in a sore arm or a sore back for days. Now, all of that has changed. With Easy Stroll, there is little need to use arm or back strength at all. Instead, leverage does the work for you. Simply change the direction you're walking and the stroller will effortlessly change a directions with you. To turn the stroller to the right, walk slightly to the left. The leverage of your entire body will easily turn the stroller to the right. Some of the control still comes from your arms, but most of the control comes from moving your feet. After a short period of time, the operation of the stroller becomes second nature and your strolling will never be the same. In addition to the control it provides, easy stroll is an ergonomic stroller handle that promotes proper posture. Baby strollers without Easy Stroll, require two hands for operation. This in turn requires \"hunching\" over the stroller, which puts an unnatural curve in your spine. Unfortunately, these improper body mechanics are unavoidable when pushing a stroller with two hands. Using single handed operation, Easy Stroll straightens your back and allows for a \"normal\" walking posture when pushing a stroller. As a result, the operator experiences no arm or back strain.",

  "green sprouts Rainbow Rattle For over two decades i play., Inc. has been researching children's health issues to make safer feeding accessories that come in contact with babies' mouths and foods. Due to recent safety issues in children's toys we saw a need for toys free from potentially harmful toxins. So in 2008 we launched a new line of PVC, phthalate, BPA and nitrosamine free toys made from synthetic materials. Inside Baby: Pregnancy and early childhood are critical times in babies' lives because they are growing and developing so rapidly. During this time they are vulnerable to elements in their environment, and parents should protect them as much as possible from exposure to potentially harmful substances. The first priority for growing babies is to make sure everything babies put inside their mouth is healthy, safe and promotes the development of strong immune system.  &#x2022; PVC free and Phthalate free: PolyVinyl Chloride (PVC) is a hard plastic that requires harsh chemical softeners, such as phthalates, to make it appropriate for use in soft plastic baby toys such as squirty toys. In 2003 we discovered that phthalates were shown to disrupt reproductive functions and cause other developmental problems, so we launched a line of toys free from PVC and phthalates.  &#x2022; BPA free: Bisphenol-A (BPA) is used in hard, clear plastics sometimes used in baby toys to prevent breakage. In 2006 we learned that BPA also disrupts reproductive functions and causes other developmental problems, so we added a line of BPA free toys to our line. &#x2022; Nitrosamine free: Nitrosamines are found in latex products such as some infant teethers. They have been shown to cause cancer in many animals, so all our teethers and soothers are nitrosamine free.",

Framed with steel alloy for safety, the seat offers side-impact protection with aluminum-reinforced sides and energy-absorbing EPS foam. Plus, it installs easily, thanks to a SuperLATCH system with a market-leading capacity of 80 pounds. The Radian80SL also boasts a handy padded carry strap, plush fabric, memory foam for superior comfort, and 3-in-1 infant/toddler full body support cushions.Radian 80SL ConvertibleCar SeatAt a Glance:Rating:Rear-facing position from 5 - 45 pounds; forward-facing up to 80 poundsIt is recommended to keep children rear facing as long as possibleIt is recommended to keep children in a 5 pt harness as long as possibleThe seat offers side-impact protection with aluminum-reinforced sides and energy-absorbing EPS foam.View larger.The 80SL features the highest weight limits in the market and a SuperLATCH system for added convenience and safety.The seat folds flat, so you can store it away or take it along for travel.(Shown here in Manhattan style.)View larger.Steel Frame and Side Impact ProtectionThe Radian 80SL Convertible Car Seat is constructed with a steel alloy frame for ultimate safety and strength, providing security for your child and peace of mind for you. The seat's side impact protection features include aluminum-reinforced sides and energy-absorbing EPS foam, which work together to protect the child's head and body and provide a thorough, superior level of protection.For added safety, the seat is also equipped with a forward- and rear-facing tether system and is the only car seat in the market to offer SafeStop technology, an energy-absorbing harness system.Easy Installation, Portability, and ConvenienceLike many car seats, the Radian allows you to easily install it by engaging the seat's Latch connectors onto a vehicle's Latch bars, which can be found in vehicles built after 2001. For drivers of vehicles without Latch, the good news is that the seat can also be easily installed with the vehicle seatbelt. For cars with Latch, the seat's SuperLATCH system is a prominent feature that offers added convenience and increased safety.What makes the Radian 80SL different? Typical Latch systems have limited weight capacities of 40-48 pounds. Once a child has reached this weight limit, instructions call for the caregiver to unlatch the seat and reinstall it using the car's seatbelt, a method that increases the likelihood of incorrect installations. The 80SL's SuperLATCH system extends that weight limit to 80 pounds. Beyond the added convenience, SuperLATCH also helps increase safety, as a Latch system is an easier installation method with less room for error than using the seatbelt method. Further easing installation is an Easy-Tite adjuster for firm fastening and rubber non-slip grips along the seat bottom to prevent car seat slippage.Because safety is a priority to Sunshine Kids, the Radian not only meets and exceeds US mandated standards, but has also been tested to the more rigorous, yet voluntary NCAP standard which simulates more severe accidents.Of particular convenience to daycare providers and parents of multiple children, the Radian's slim design fits three across in most vehicles, making it ideal for sedans and smaller SUVs. Plus, it still provides ample shoulder room for growing children. Yet another unique feature of this car seat, the Radian is the only convertible car seat on the market that folds flat, so you can store it away and take it along for travel. The Radian 80SL also features a handy padded shoulder strap.Comfort Features for Growing ChildrenThis innovative car seat will grow with your child from infancy to childhood and is designed with several features to ensure your child's comfort, whether you're driving across town to the babysitter's or across the country for the holidays. These comfort features include comfort foam padding, a long seat, adjustable seat positions, and 3-in-1 infant/toddler full body support cushions.Especially pleasant for those long rides, the memory foam padding around the seat, plush fabric, and extended seat bottom combine for an extra comfortable fit. The forward facing dual recline positions offer the child the recline angle of their choice. Additionally, the five harness positions and three buckle positions make it easier than ever to customize the car seat to ensure your child is properly secured as he or she grows.And featuring the two highest weight limits in the market, this convertible car seat is suitable in the rear-facing position from 5 to 45 pounds. When children are old enough, they can be positioned in the forward-facing position up to a weight of 80 pounds. And for easy child-boarding, the seat is designed to sit low on the seat.The car seat is covered with a micro-fiber velour material that comes in a grey-circle motif with charcoal velour trim for fashionable families.About the Company: Modern Products for Today's Busy FamiliesSunshine Kids Juvenile Products has over 10 years of experience in designing innovative, thoughtful products that are both safe and convenient.

By pulling the ends of the twist tie together you now have a neatly packaged serving of nutritious breast milk. The bags are puncture-resistant and sturdy enough for the freezer, and they come with measurement indicators in ounces and milliliters and a label where you can record the date and time you expressed the milk.

  "green sprouts Organic Terry Circus Animal Teether-Cornflower Tiger For over two decades i play., Inc. has been researching children's health issues to make safer feeding accessories that come in contact with babies' mouths and foods. Due to recent safety issues in children's toys we saw a need for toys free from potentially harmful toxins. So in 2008 we launched a new line of PVC, phthalate, BPA and nitrosamine free toys made from synthetic materials. Inside Baby: Pregnancy and early childhood are critical times in babies' lives because they are growing and developing so rapidly. During this time they are vulnerable to elements in their environment, and parents should protect them as much as possible from exposure to potentially harmful substances. The first priority for growing babies is to make sure everything babies put inside their mouth is healthy, safe and promotes the development of strong immune system.  &#x2022; PVC free and Phthalate free: PolyVinyl Chloride (PVC) is a hard plastic that requires harsh chemical softeners, such as phthalates, to make it appropriate for use in soft plastic baby toys such as squirty toys. In 2003 we discovered that phthalates were shown to disrupt reproductive functions and cause other developmental problems, so we launched a line of toys free from PVC and phthalates.  &#x2022; BPA free: Bisphenol-A (BPA) is used in hard, clear plastics sometimes used in baby toys to prevent breakage. In 2006 we learned that BPA also disrupts reproductive functions and causes other developmental problems, so we added a line of BPA free toys to our line. &#x2022; Nitrosamine free: Nitrosamines are found in latex products such as some infant teethers. They have been shown to cause cancer in many animals, so all our teethers and soothers are nitrosamine free.",

For 11 years, the firm fabricated machine and car parts for local manufacturers. In 1953, Gray left the firm, leaving Cone as sole owner. Cone decided to manufacture his own line of products, but had trouble coming up with ideas. Enter David Saint, an engineer, tinkerer, and stained glass artisan who worked for Graco. Saint, himself a father of nine, was intrigued when an associate told him how his wife would soothe their tired and cranky baby while swinging in a backyard glider swing. Acting on this inspiration, he went to the drawing board and 18 months of hard work later, the world's first wind-up infant swing, the Graco Swyngomatic, was born. Graco sold millions of Swyngomatics in the coming years, becoming one of the world's leading manufacturers of juvenile products in the process. Today, Graco is a Newell Rubbermaid company, with 1500 associates worldwide. While a half-century has brought many changes to Graco, their dedication and commitment to designing and manufacturing top-quality products remains, and continues on.What's in the BoxGraco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame.",

  "Baby Buddy Bottle Buddy The Electronic Formula Dispenser, White Bottle Buddy is a unique electronic formula dispensing product that accurately counts a pre-set amount of powdered infant and follow on formula into a baby's bottle. Using Bottle Buddy to make up a feeding is convenient, quick and easy to use and, most importantly, it saves time and ensures that every bottle contains the right amount of formula every time. It&#x2019;s a common, yet annoying, mistake to make: you're preparing a bottle for your baby and counting the amount of powder into the bottle when someone or something interrupts you. Before you know it, you&#x2019;re wondering: &#x201C;was that five or six scoops?&#x201D; and have to start over again. Bottle Buddy eliminates the risk of contamination, human error and spillage by delivering an adjustable, preset, consistent quantity of powder at a touch of a button. Bottle Buddy is ideal for new parents or caretakers who may be nervous about formula quantities. Bottle Buddy is set to revolutionize the way parents make up their babies' bottles forever. Benefits Breast milk is generally thought to be best for babies but there are a number of good reasons why many mothers choose to bottle feed from birth or only breast feed for a short while. Some parents supplement breast milk with powdered infant or follow-on formula - especially as the baby gets older. Whatever they choose, all parents want to see their baby thrive and grow at a healthy rate. On average, parents put over 10,000 scoops of infant or follow-on formula into bottles in the first year of a baby&#x2019;s life. It is not only very time consuming but also very easy to miscount the amount of formula used, especially when holding a crying, hungry baby and trying to make up a bottle at the same time. Using Bottle Buddy to make up a feeding ensures that every bottle contains the correct amount of formula and overcomes some of the serious health risks associated with formula feeding. Miscounting scoops, overfeeding or underfeeding on a regular basis can have long-term health implications.",

The Miracle Blanket is made of the highest quality (and cozy) materials available and is stitched with great attention to detail.

  "Little Dundi My Early Steps Baby Walker, Tan My Early Steps is a soft-structured baby walker for use with infants who have demonstrated an ability to stand while supporting themselves against furniture or holding onto an adult's hand. This is indicative of completed changes in bodily proportion and sufficient leg muscle strength needed to enable the ability to balance in upright posture. My Early Steps is recommended for use with infants with a minimum chest circumference of 19 inches, weighing less than 30 pounds, and at least 8 months old. The unique shell design promotes a natural posture for baby &#x2013; the arms are used for balancing, which is key to maintaining balance while transitioning from one foot to the other, and the risk of shoulder dislocation caused by assisting adults pulling on baby&#x2019;s arms is minimized. Baby receives visual feedback related to each step as the view of baby's feet is unobstructed. The processing of such visual feedback by the brain is essential for independent walking. The adult also benefits from maintaining a natural, upright posture while using the walker. The lower part of the walker absorbs part of baby's weight and prevents the top part from gathering up under baby's arms during use, causing them to extend upwards. The wide leg openings allow for free leg movement and baby can gradually build up the upper muscle strength required for independent walking. The most unique feature of My Early Steps is the three-point fastening on the back. Situated close to the center of gravity of the baby it includes the lower point of attachment of the support straps. This is important because babies' center of gravity lies much higher than that of adults, making them top heavy. Positioning the point of attachment of the support straps close to the center of gravity affords better control for the adult and increased support for the top heavy infant. The support straps are easily removable and adjustable in length to accommodate adults of various heights. Babies can frequently tire of walking practice and want to switch to crawling. It is possible to let baby crawl without undue risk of entanglement - no need to remove the entire baby walker from baby, only the support straps. The three-point fastening allows for adjustments for baby's height and chest circumference (or thicker outerwear) and makes it possible to create a snug fi",

  "Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer Bleary-eyed parents who scramble to heat bottles in the middle of the night while their baby screams will rejoice at the simplicity and speed with which the Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer warms milk (and food) to just the right temperature. All they need to do is place the filled bottle in the warmer, fill the warmer with water, plug in, and wait for the neon light to flash on and off. In four to six minutes, baby has his bottle.The DetailsWhether a parent is heating breastmilk, formula, or pureed peas; using Avent bottles, other brands, or baby food jars; the Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer gently and evenly heats baby&#x92;s meal. The included plastic basket is used inside the warmer to keep baby food jars and Avent bottles upright. It can be removed when heating the Avent Magic cup and other makes of bottles. Water is added to just above the level of the milk in the bottle (or below the top of baby food jar). Plug the unit into an electrical outlet and click the switch on. A neon light will illuminate. Turn the dial to the appropriate setting (3 for Avent feeding bottles and baby food jars, and 2 for Avent Disposable System). When the bottle has been in the warmer for the appropriate length of time (a guide is included, based on whether the bottle is at room temperature or refrigerated to start), the light will flash. Test the temperature and reheat if necessary or serve.Don&#x92;t forget to switch the warmer off and unplug it!Why Not Just Use the Microwave?The microwave is never recommended for heating baby bottles or food. It&#x92;s difficult to judge just how much time is needed, and even brief heating can create \"hot spots,\" which can burn baby. In addition, important nutrients may be lost in microwave heating.How About Just Putting the Bottle in a Bowl of Warm Water?Sure, if you (and your baby) don&#x92;t mind standing by the sink waiting for the water from the tap to warm up, then waiting for the bottle to warm, checking, checking again, and again&#x85;Get Out of the KitchenMidnight runs back and forth to the kitchen are not high on the list of favorite activities for most parents. A pleasant bonus to using the Avent Express Warmer is that it can be set up in the bedroom, bathroom, nursery&#x85;anywhere there is an outlet. Having the bottle warmer and fixings set up close to the action (not too close, though&#x97;mind the safety precautions) can subtract minutes from the whole process. And as any parent will tell you, every minute counts.What&#x92;s in the BoxThe Avent Express warming system includes bottle-warming unit, basket, feeding spoon, four-ounce Avent bottle with top (nipple not included), and instruction manual with time/temperature guide. All Avent products work together and are completely interchangeable.Note: It is possible to overheat a bottle or jar of food with this system. If you find that a bottle is not warm enough after the allotted time, you may replace it in the warmer, but remember that, although the water surrounding the bottle will remain at a constant temperature, the contents of the bottle or jar will continue to heat. Always test the milk or food before feeding baby. Use all normal and necessary safeguards when using this electrical appliance.--Emilie Coulter",

During the first months of life, babies learn how to move their bodies and gain the necessary physical strength for rolling over, sitting up, and crawling. Besides the physical benefits of tummy time, giving your infant playtime on his belly will help minimize any flat spots on his head that may have come from sleeping on his back.The Spin and Explore offers both you and your baby a soft and safe space to make tummy time a pleasurable part of everyday activities. Baby can gently and comfortably spin around on her tummy, stretching and strengthening her upper and lower body while enjoying lots of squeaky, crinkly, tactile fun. After your baby can sit up on her own, you can remove the spinner and let her take advantage of the other visually and physically stimulating features, like the peek-a-boo leaf flap and mirror.Fun, Innovative DesignWinner of Redbook's \"Hottest Toys of the 2007 Holiday Season,\" and a Toy Insider 2007 Top 20 pick, the Spin and Explore provides an innovative platform with a unique shape and rotating motion to encourage exploration and give babies the confidence they need to try new things. As his coordination grows, baby is more likely to want to attempt new skills--like twirling around on his tummy to visit his garden pals for tactile play, interaction that motivates him to hold his head up, use his legs, and spin on his stomach.The Spin and Explore can be used with or without the platform and also includes little loops to attach other toys to the play mat. It measures 28.0 x 5.5 x 28.0 inches (WxHxD) and comes with a garden-theme play mat, spinning platform, and ladybug platform cover.

For 11 years, the firm fabricated machine and car parts for local manufacturers. In 1953, Gray left the firm, leaving Cone as sole owner. Cone decided to manufacture his own line of products, but had trouble coming up with ideas. Enter David Saint, an engineer, tinkerer, and stained glass artisan who worked for Graco. Saint, himself a father of nine, was intrigued when an associate told him how his wife would soothe their tired and cranky baby while swinging in a backyard glider swing. Acting on this inspiration, he went to the drawing board and 18 months of hard work later, the world's first wind-up infant swing, the Graco Swyngomatic, was born. Graco sold millions of Swyngomatics in the coming years, becoming one of the world's leading manufacturers of juvenile products in the process. Today, Graco is a Newell Rubbermaid company, with 1500 associates worldwide. While a half-century has brought many changes to Graco, their dedication and commitment to designing and manufacturing top-quality products remains, and continues on.What's In the BoxGraco SnugRide Infant Car Seat Base (Metallic Silver).Learn more about Graco Classic Connect vs Click Connect compatibility here.",

The Kids Cup is a spout-free, valve-free cup made without BPA, Phthalates and PVC, and is designed to transition young children properly from bottles to real glass dinnerware.

  "Disana Organic Merino Wool Cover-Natural-86/92 (12-24 mo) This double-knit wool diaper cover is made from lovely, soft organic wool that is ideal for even the smallest babies with sensitive skin.  An excellent alternative to synthetic covers, wool soakers are naturally antibacterial and provide excellent moisture regulation.  Wool wicks moisture away from the skin and can absorb up to one third of its weight in moisture and return it to the environment. Once it is prepped and ready for use, you will have no leaks at all with this wool cover, making it an excellent choice for night time.       \n\nThese covers can be used over any pre-fold or fitted cloth diaper, and the high knitted waistband provides a nice fit over any type of diaper, no matter how bulky or high-fitting the diaper is.  This soft ribbed waist band also keeps your baby's tummy and back warm and cozy throughout the night.  The thick double-knit wool is perfect for night time use.  Disana wool covers are wonderful for night time and once properly prepared (washed and lanolized), your baby should never have leak while wearing this cover.  \n\nSize/ Fit: These covers will shrink a bit after washing, so it's not a bad idea to size up.  The style of these covers are similar to our Engel double-knit nappy covers but have a slightly different shape. The legs on disana covers are a bit more snug than the Engel covers, which is nice for containing leaks, but do keep this in mind if your baby has chunkier legs.",

  "Baby Buddy Bottle Buddy The Electronic Formula Dispenser, White Bottle Buddy is a unique electronic formula dispensing product that accurately counts a pre-set amount of powdered infant and follow on formula into a baby's bottle. Using Bottle Buddy to make up a feeding is convenient, quick and easy to use and, most importantly, it saves time and ensures that every bottle contains the right amount of formula every time. It&#x2019;s a common, yet annoying, mistake to make: you're preparing a bottle for your baby and counting the amount of powder into the bottle when someone or something interrupts you. Before you know it, you&#x2019;re wondering: &#x201C;was that five or six scoops?&#x201D; and have to start over again. Bottle Buddy eliminates the risk of contamination, human error and spillage by delivering an adjustable, preset, consistent quantity of powder at a touch of a button. Bottle Buddy is ideal for new parents or caretakers who may be nervous about formula quantities. Bottle Buddy is set to revolutionize the way parents make up their babies' bottles forever. Benefits Breast milk is generally thought to be best for babies but there are a number of good reasons why many mothers choose to bottle feed from birth or only breast feed for a short while. Some parents supplement breast milk with powdered infant or follow-on formula - especially as the baby gets older. Whatever they choose, all parents want to see their baby thrive and grow at a healthy rate. On average, parents put over 10,000 scoops of infant or follow-on formula into bottles in the first year of a baby&#x2019;s life. It is not only very time consuming but also very easy to miscount the amount of formula used, especially when holding a crying, hungry baby and trying to make up a bottle at the same time. Using Bottle Buddy to make up a feeding ensures that every bottle contains the correct amount of formula and overcomes some of the serious health risks associated with formula feeding. Miscounting scoops, overfeeding or underfeeding on a regular basis can have long-term health implications.",

And the DEX Sound Sleeper is one of the best ones we&rsquo;ve ever found. This small (6 by 10 by 12 inches), simple device features a high quality speaker, on/off or 60-minute timer switch, volume control, single, combine, or random mode, power adapter capability, headphone jack (headphones not included), and, most spectacularly, 10 sound options which can be combined to make 24 sound combinations altogether.Doctors and sleep experts recommend a consistent, relaxing sleep routine for newborns and older babies. Freeing baby&rsquo;s sleep environment of jarring or distracting outside noises is an important step in creating a soothing space for sleep. The Sound Sleeper provides just enough peaceful background noise to block household hubbub. Once baby becomes familiar with the sounds of this machine, she&rsquo;ll probably start yawning the minute she hears it!The Sounds of (Near) SilenceThe sounds of Sound Sleeper don&rsquo;t have to be boring, just relaxing and repetitive.

We like Brook and Bird, Wind and Thunder, and Ocean and Buoy, but who knows?

  "green sprouts Natural Wood Ring Rattle For over two decades i play., Inc. has been researching children's health issues to make safer feeding accessories that come in contact with babies' mouths and foods. Due to recent safety issues in children's toys we saw a need for toys free from potentially harmful toxins. So in 2008 we launched a new line of PVC, phthalate, BPA and nitrosamine free toys made from synthetic materials. Inside Baby: Pregnancy and early childhood are critical times in babies' lives because they are growing and developing so rapidly. During this time they are vulnerable to elements in their environment, and parents should protect them as much as possible from exposure to potentially harmful substances. The first priority for growing babies is to make sure everything babies put inside their mouth is healthy, safe and promotes the development of strong immune system.  &#x2022; PVC free and Phthalate free: PolyVinyl Chloride (PVC) is a hard plastic that requires harsh chemical softeners, such as phthalates, to make it appropriate for use in soft plastic baby toys such as squirty toys. In 2003 we discovered that phthalates were shown to disrupt reproductive functions and cause other developmental problems, so we launched a line of toys free from PVC and phthalates.  &#x2022; BPA free: Bisphenol-A (BPA) is used in hard, clear plastics sometimes used in baby toys to prevent breakage. In 2006 we learned that BPA also disrupts reproductive functions and causes other developmental problems, so we added a line of BPA free toys to our line. &#x2022; Nitrosamine free: Nitrosamines are found in latex products such as some infant teethers. They have been shown to cause cancer in many animals, so all our teethers and soothers are nitrosamine free.",

  "Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer Bleary-eyed parents who scramble to heat bottles in the middle of the night while their baby screams will rejoice at the simplicity and speed with which the Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer warms milk (and food) to just the right temperature. All they need to do is place the filled bottle in the warmer, fill the warmer with water, plug in, and wait for the neon light to flash on and off. In four to six minutes, baby has his bottle.The DetailsWhether a parent is heating breastmilk, formula, or pureed peas; using Avent bottles, other brands, or baby food jars; the Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer gently and evenly heats baby&#x92;s meal. The included plastic basket is used inside the warmer to keep baby food jars and Avent bottles upright. It can be removed when heating the Avent Magic cup and other makes of bottles. Water is added to just above the level of the milk in the bottle (or below the top of baby food jar). Plug the unit into an electrical outlet and click the switch on. A neon light will illuminate. Turn the dial to the appropriate setting (3 for Avent feeding bottles and baby food jars, and 2 for Avent Disposable System). When the bottle has been in the warmer for the appropriate length of time (a guide is included, based on whether the bottle is at room temperature or refrigerated to start), the light will flash. Test the temperature and reheat if necessary or serve.Don&#x92;t forget to switch the warmer off and unplug it!Why Not Just Use the Microwave?The microwave is never recommended for heating baby bottles or food. It&#x92;s difficult to judge just how much time is needed, and even brief heating can create \"hot spots,\" which can burn baby. In addition, important nutrients may be lost in microwave heating.How About Just Putting the Bottle in a Bowl of Warm Water?Sure, if you (and your baby) don&#x92;t mind standing by the sink waiting for the water from the tap to warm up, then waiting for the bottle to warm, checking, checking again, and again&#x85;Get Out of the KitchenMidnight runs back and forth to the kitchen are not high on the list of favorite activities for most parents. A pleasant bonus to using the Avent Express Warmer is that it can be set up in the bedroom, bathroom, nursery&#x85;anywhere there is an outlet. Having the bottle warmer and fixings set up close to the action (not too close, though&#x97;mind the safety precautions) can subtract minutes from the whole process. And as any parent will tell you, every minute counts.What&#x92;s in the BoxThe Avent Express warming system includes bottle-warming unit, basket, feeding spoon, four-ounce Avent bottle with top (nipple not included), and instruction manual with time/temperature guide. All Avent products work together and are completely interchangeable.Note: It is possible to overheat a bottle or jar of food with this system. If you find that a bottle is not warm enough after the allotted time, you may replace it in the warmer, but remember that, although the water surrounding the bottle will remain at a constant temperature, the contents of the bottle or jar will continue to heat. Always test the milk or food before feeding baby. Use all normal and necessary safeguards when using this electrical appliance.--Emilie Coulter",
  "The Original Art of CureTM *SAFETY KNOTTED* Multi Colored Round - Genuine Baltic Amber Baby Teething Necklace - w/&quot;The Art of Cure&quot; Jewelry Pouch WHAT ALL THE MOMS ARE RAVING ABOUT!!!\n\nBALTIC AMBER TEETHING JEWELRY? \nThe Art of Cure Brand AND Trademark is dedicated to providing the highest quality for Teething Babies. \n\nBaltic amber Jewelry is made for wearing (not chewing) when a baby is teething to reduce inflammation in the body. The warmth from the skin releases the active ingredient in the Baltic amber, succinic acid. Recent scientific research has proved that succinic acid has a very positive influence on the human body. It improves immunity and the balance of acids when absorbed into the bloodstream; it stimulates the thyroid glands to help reduce drooling when used for teething and soothes red inflamed cheeks. Amber's anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties are recognized by allopathic medicine as a natural analgesic, which will help to relieve teething pain and calm a baby without resorting to drugs. The skin's warmth releases healing oils from the amber, a resin, which is absorbed into the bloodstream.\n Parent supervision is recommended at all times. \nThey are 12-12.5 in. \nPackaging is custom from The Art of Cure and comes with a Keepsake pouch. \nThe Art of Cure Baltic Amber is guaranteed to be of the highest quality and made to the best standards. \nAuthenticity documents like a certificate of authenticity, testing and safety documents available upon request.",

This is a huge savings over the cost of regular diapers. Plus, your child will never have any harsh chemicals touching their skin. Many mothers get overwhelmed when deciding on what brand of cloth diapers to buy, but LOOK NO FURTHER! The Mother-ease diaper system consists of three components: a fitted cloth diaper, an absorbent liner for additional protection at night or whenever needed, and a breathable, waterproof diaper cover worn over the diaper. These products can be purchased individually or in packages. Finally! A leak-proof cloth diaper cover that refuses to compromise breathability! We searched for over a year to find just the right fabric that would meet our quality standards. The fabric needed to be soft, durable and waterproof. The Air Flow Snap Cover, with adjustable snaps at the waist and leg openings has an air ventilation system between the snaps. This allows for maximum air circulation as baby moves, reducing the risk of bacteria by keeping the temperature inside the cloth diaper down. And, unlike Velcro, the curious baby can't undo them, so they stay on until you take them off.",

  "Thinkbaby Thinkster Straw Bottle, 9 Ounce, Natural/Orange When we introduced the thinkbaby over 4 years ago 95% of the baby bottles on the market were made of polycarbonate which contains BPA. Initially, we attempted to convince the major companies to move off of polycarbonate, but after being unsuccessful we launched thinkbaby and thinksport to address the concern of chemicals leaching from consumer products. We started with the baby bottle because polycarbonate was ubiquitous across the industry. As little ones systems are still in a state of development they have very little defense against foreign chemicals. While many companies have emerged to offer BPA free baby bottles, many bottles not only still contain BPA despite saying BPA free (see Health Canada study), but many companies have also landed on untested materials just because the material claims to be free of BPA. thinkbaby utilizes the precautionary principle in the creation of all of our products. The top of the bottle features a easy to close cover to keep it from coming into contact with foreign substances. The thinkster is made from No. 5 plastic and therefore can be recycled after use.",

  "Little Dundi My Early Steps Baby Walker, Tan My Early Steps is a soft-structured baby walker for use with infants who have demonstrated an ability to stand while supporting themselves against furniture or holding onto an adult's hand. This is indicative of completed changes in bodily proportion and sufficient leg muscle strength needed to enable the ability to balance in upright posture. My Early Steps is recommended for use with infants with a minimum chest circumference of 19 inches, weighing less than 30 pounds, and at least 8 months old. The unique shell design promotes a natural posture for baby &#x2013; the arms are used for balancing, which is key to maintaining balance while transitioning from one foot to the other, and the risk of shoulder dislocation caused by assisting adults pulling on baby&#x2019;s arms is minimized. Baby receives visual feedback related to each step as the view of baby's feet is unobstructed. The processing of such visual feedback by the brain is essential for independent walking. The adult also benefits from maintaining a natural, upright posture while using the walker. The lower part of the walker absorbs part of baby's weight and prevents the top part from gathering up under baby's arms during use, causing them to extend upwards. The wide leg openings allow for free leg movement and baby can gradually build up the upper muscle strength required for independent walking. The most unique feature of My Early Steps is the three-point fastening on the back. Situated close to the center of gravity of the baby it includes the lower point of attachment of the support straps. This is important because babies' center of gravity lies much higher than that of adults, making them top heavy. Positioning the point of attachment of the support straps close to the center of gravity affords better control for the adult and increased support for the top heavy infant. The support straps are easily removable and adjustable in length to accommodate adults of various heights. Babies can frequently tire of walking practice and want to switch to crawling. It is possible to let baby crawl without undue risk of entanglement - no need to remove the entire baby walker from baby, only the support straps. The three-point fastening allows for adjustments for baby's height and chest circumference (or thicker outerwear) and makes it possible to create a snug fi",
